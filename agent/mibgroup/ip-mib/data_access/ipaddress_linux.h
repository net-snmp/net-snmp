 *
 * 1) prefer functionality over platform, where possible. If a method
 *    is available for multiple platforms, test that first. That way
 *    when a new platform is ported, it won't need a new test here.
 *
 * 2) don't do detail requirements here. If, for example,
 *    HPUX11 had different reuirements than other HPUX, that should
 *    be handled in the *_hpux.h header file.
