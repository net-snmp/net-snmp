[1] What is SMUX?
SMUX is the snmp multiplexing protocol (RFC 1227). It can be
used by an snmp agent to query variables maintained by another
user-level process (e.g. gated).

[2] Why is it relevant to ucd-snmp?
The ucd-snmp agent needed a mechanism to query statistics from
gated. gated has traditionally supported this functionality via
SMUX. Hence SMUX was implemented within the ucd-snmp framework
to extract routing protocol statistics from gated. 

[3] What is gated?
gated is the 'Gateway Daemon' which implements a variety of routing
protocols on a variety of platforms (OSes).

[4] What routing protocol mibs does ucd-snmp SMUX support?
It currently supports the RIP2, OSPF and BGP mibs.

[5] Can SMUX extract statistics from other user-level processes?
SMUX as a general purpose protocol can do so. The ucd-snmp
implementation is custom designed to talk to gated. It can however be
easily extended.

[6] How does it work?
Assuming 'snmpd' is already up and running, when gated comes up, it
establishes a TCP connection on Port 199 with snmpd. It then registers
certain mibs with snmpd. This is currently hard wired in ucd-snmp SMUX
to the RIP2, OSPF and BGP mibs.

Thru regular mechanisms, an snmp GET/GETNEXT query, which falls into the RIP2, 
OSPF, BGP mib subtrees, percolates down to the appropriate var_XXX function. 
A smux handler is called which bundles this query into an snmp pdu and passes 
it to gated.  gated looks for the variable and replies. The reply is passed 
back as a regular GETRESP to the querying application by snmpd.

[7] Who implemented SMUX for ucd-snmp?
SMUX was implemented by Rohit Dube. He had oodles of help from
ucd-snmp-coders (Dave, Niels, Wes, Simon, Felix, Leonti) and 
gated-people (Acee, Feiyi, Larry, Sue). [If I missed somebody, sorry in 
advance and do let me know].
