      (see snmptrapd.conf(5))
    - More configuration files have been created and can be used to
      specify defaults and configuration information to the various
      applications.  Run each command with -H to see what it understands.
      (see snmp_config(5), snmpd.conf(5), snmp.conf(5), snmptrapd.conf(5))
    - The configuration file parser looks in ~/.snmp by default as
      well, allowing each user to have his/her own setup files for the

      strictly it parses mib files.
      (see snmpcmd.1 on "-P")

 Copyright:
    - Simplification.

*3.5*

 New:
    - agent/mibgroup directory reorganized hierarchically.
      - this may break the agent compilation with some compilers.
    - floats, doubles, counter64s, int64s, uint64s support via opaque types.

    - The header file #defines have changed.  You may have to compile
      third party applications with -DCMU_COMPATIBLE (like perl-SNMP <= V1.7).
    - The parser is more strict about unlinked OIDs and end-of-comment
      conditions.  You may see problems in a few broken mibs that used
      to parse ok with the older parser.

 New:
    - dynamic library support:  configure with --enable-shared.
    - the beginnings of a Perl/Tk/SNMP mib browser: tkmib
    - all applications support -R for random oid-name lookups.

    - snmptrap sends to the correct default port of 162 again.

 Ports:
    - irix 6.2 support improved.
    - openbsd.
    - the host resources mib compiles on Solaris.

*3.3.1*

 New:
    - "make install" installs the library and header files.

 Fixes:
    - compilation on many architectures (sunos for example).
    - snmptrapd doesn't exit if v2party files don't exist.
    - host resources works a bit better (ie, it compiles) under solaris.
    

*3.3*

  Path changes:

      changed to /usr/local/share/snmp (set differently using --datadir).
    - the default path of the snmpd and snmptrapd have changed to
      /usr/local/sbin (set differently using --sbindir).

  New:
    - basic SNMPV2c support.  
      - Not fully tested (feedback please!), and not RFC compliant.

    - irix should be more complete.
    - aix 4.1.5.
    - fixes for hpux 10.20.

  Fixes:
    - too numerous to mention.

*3.2*

  New:
    - Top level of the mib parser has been restructured
      - no longer reads 'mib.txt'
      - no longer reads everything (MIBS/MIBDIRS)
      - reads import clauses to load other required modules
      - new man page: mib_api.3
    - The agent has been completely restructured (modularized) to

      new C coded mib modules.  See the README file in the
      agent/mibgroup subdirectory for details.  Modules are added and/or
      removed via configure options.
