                      The only value which may be set by a management

                      and a non-Idle peer to reinitiate neighbor

                      to return to the Idle state until a Start event
                      occurs, either via egpNeighEventTrigger or

          -- group is mandatory for that system.

          -- When Internet-standard definitions for managing
          -- transmission media are defined, the transmission group is
          -- used to provide a prefix for the names of those objects.

          -- Typically, such definitions reside in the experimental
          -- portion of the MIB until they are "proven", then as a
          -- part of the Internet standardization process, the
          -- definitions are accordingly elevated and a new object
          -- identifier, under the transmission group is defined. By

          --
          --     type OBJECT IDENTIFIER    ::= { transmission number }

              DESCRIPTION
                      "The RowStatus textual convention is used to
                      manage the creation and deletion of conceptual
                      rows, and is used as the value of the SYNTAX

                      (as described in Section 7.7.1 of [2].)

                      The status column has six defined values:

                           - 'active', which indicates that the
                           conceptual row is available for use by the
                           managed device;

                           - 'notInService', which indicates that the
                           conceptual row exists in the agent, but is
                           unavailable for use by the managed device
                           (see NOTE below);

                           - 'notReady', which indicates that the
                           conceptual row exists in the agent, but is
                           missing information necessary in order to be
                           available for use by the managed device;

                           - 'createAndGo', which is supplied by a
                           management station wishing to create a new
                           instance of a conceptual row and to have it
                           available for use by the managed device;

                           - 'createAndWait', which is supplied by a
                           management station wishing to create a new
                           instance of a conceptual row but not to have
                           it available for use by the managed device;
                           and,

                           - 'destroy', which is supplied by a
                           management station wishing to delete all of
                           the instances associated with an existing
                           conceptual row.

                      Whereas five of the six values (all except
                      'notReady') may be specified in a management
                      protocol set operation, only three values will be
                      returned in response to a management protocol


                      retrieval operation: 'notReady', 'notInService' or
                      'active'.  That is, when queried, an existing
                      conceptual row has only three states: it is either
                      available for use by the managed device (the
                      status column has value 'active'); it is not
                      available for use by the managed device, though
                      the agent has sufficient information to make it so
                      (the status column has value 'notInService'); or,
                      it is not available for use by the managed device,
                      because the agent lacks sufficient information
                      (the status column has value 'notReady').

                                          NOTE WELL

                           This textual convention may be used for a MIB
                           table, irrespective of whether the values of
                           that table's conceptual rows are able to be
                           modified while it is active, or whether its
                           conceptual rows must be taken out of service
                           in order to be modified.  That is, it is the
                           responsibility of the DESCRIPTION clause of
                           the status column to specify whether the
                           status column must be 'notInService' in order
                           for the value of some other column of the
                           same conceptual row to be modified.


                      To summarize the effect of having a conceptual row
                      with a status column having a SYNTAX clause value
                      of RowStatus, consider the following state
                      diagram:

                                   Conceptual Row Creation

                      There are four potential interactions when
                      creating a conceptual row: selecting an instance-
                      identifier which is not in use; creating the
                      conceptual row; initializing any objects for which
                      the agent does not supply a default; and, making
                      the conceptual row available for use by the
                      managed device.

                      Interaction 1: Selecting an Instance-Identifier

                      The algorithm used to select an instance-
                      identifier varies for each conceptual row.  In
                      some cases, the instance-identifier is
                      semantically significant, e.g., the destination
                      address of a route, and a management station
                      selects the instance-identifier according to the
                      semantics.

                      In other cases, the instance-identifier is used
                      solely to distinguish conceptual rows, and a
                      management station without specific knowledge of
                      the conceptual row might examine the instances


                      present in order to determine an unused instance-
                      identifier.  (This approach may be used, but it is
                      often highly sub-optimal; however, it is also a
                      questionable practice for a naive management
                      station to attempt conceptual row creation.)

                      Alternately, the MIB module which defines the
                      conceptual row might provide one or more objects
                      which provide assistance in determining an unused
                      instance-identifier.  For example, if the
                      conceptual row is indexed by an integer-value,
                      then an object having an integer-valued SYNTAX
                      clause might be defined for such a purpose,
                      allowing a management station to issue a
                      management protocol retrieval operation.  In order
                      to avoid unnecessary collisions between competing
                      management stations, 'adjacent' retrievals of this
                      object should be different.

                      Finally, the management station could select a
                      pseudo-random number to use as the index.  In the
                      event that this index was already in use and an
                      inconsistentValue was returned in response to the
                      management protocol set operation, the management
                      station should simply select a new pseudo-random
                      number and retry the operation.

                      A MIB designer should choose between the two
                      latter algorithms based on the size of the table
                      (and therefore the efficiency of each algorithm).
                      For tables in which a large number of entries are
                      expected, it is recommended that a MIB object be
                      defined that returns an acceptable index for
                      creation.  For tables with small numbers of
                      entries, it is recommended that the latter
                      pseudo-random index mechanism be used.

                      Interaction 2: Creating the Conceptual Row

                      Once an unused instance-identifier has been
                      selected, the management station determines if it
                      wishes to create and activate the conceptual row
                      in one transaction or in a negotiated set of
                      interactions.


                      Interaction 2a: Creating and Activating the
                      Conceptual Row

                      The management station must first determine the
                      column requirements, i.e., it must determine those
                      columns for which it must or must not provide
                      values.  Depending on the complexity of the table
                      and the management station's knowledge of the
                      agent's capabilities, this determination can be
                      made locally by the management station.
                      Alternately, the management station issues a
                      management protocol get operation to examine all
                      columns in the conceptual row that it wishes to
                      create.  In response, for each column, there are
                      three possible outcomes:

                           - a value is returned, indicating that some
                           other management station has already created
                           this conceptual row.  We return to
                           interaction 1.

                           - the exception 'noSuchInstance' is returned,
                           indicating that the agent implements the
                           object-type associated with this column, and
                           that this column in at least one conceptual
                           row would be accessible in the MIB view used
                           by the retrieval were it to exist. For those
                           columns to which the agent provides read-
                           create access, the 'noSuchInstance' exception
                           tells the management station that it should
                           supply a value for this column when the
                           conceptual row is to be created.

                           - the exception 'noSuchObject' is returned,
                           indicating that the agent does not implement
                           the object-type associated with this column
                           or that there is no conceptual row for which
                           this column would be accessible in the MIB
                           view used by the retrieval.  As such, the
                           management station can not issue any
                           management protocol set operations to create
                           an instance of this column.

                      Once the column requirements have been determined,
                      a management protocol set operation is accordingly


                      issued.  This operation also sets the new instance
                      of the status column to 'createAndGo'.

                      When the agent processes the set operation, it
                      verifies that it has sufficient information to
                      make the conceptual row available for use by the
                      managed device.  The information available to the
                      agent is provided by two sources: the management
                      protocol set operation which creates the
                      conceptual row, and, implementation-specific
                      defaults supplied by the agent (note that an agent
                      must provide implementation-specific defaults for
                      at least those objects which it implements as
                      read-only).  If there is sufficient information
                      available, then the conceptual row is created, a
                      'noError' response is returned, the status column
                      is set to 'active', and no further interactions
                      are necessary (i.e., interactions 3 and 4 are
                      skipped).  If there is insufficient information,
                      then the conceptual row is not created, and the
                      set operation fails with an error of
                      'inconsistentValue'.  On this error, the
                      management station can issue a management protocol
                      retrieval operation to determine if this was
                      because it failed to specify a value for a
                      required column, or, because the selected instance
                      of the status column already existed.  In the
                      latter case, we return to interaction 1.  In the
                      former case, the management station can re-issue
                      the set operation with the additional information,
                      or begin interaction 2 again using 'createAndWait'
                      in order to negotiate creation of the conceptual
                      row.


                                          NOTE WELL

                           Regardless of the method used to determine
                           the column requirements, it is possible that
                           the management station might deem a column
                           necessary when, in fact, the agent will not
                           allow that particular columnar instance to be
                           created or written.  In this case, the
                           management protocol set operation will fail
                           with an error such as 'noCreation' or
                           'notWritable'.  In this case, the management
                           station decides whether it needs to be able
                           to set a value for that particular columnar
                           instance.  If not, the management station
                           re-issues the management protocol set
                           operation, but without setting a value for
                           that particular columnar instance; otherwise,
                           the management station aborts the row
                           creation algorithm.

                      Interaction 2b: Negotiating the Creation of the
                      Conceptual Row

                      The management station issues a management
                      protocol set operation which sets the desired
                      instance of the status column to 'createAndWait'.
                      If the agent is unwilling to process a request of
                      this sort, the set operation fails with an error
                      of 'wrongValue'.  (As a consequence, such an agent
                      must be prepared to accept a single management
                      protocol set operation, i.e., interaction 2a
                      above, containing all of the columns indicated by
                      its column requirements.) Otherwise, the
                      conceptual row is created, a 'noError' response is
                      returned, and the status column is immediately set
                      to either 'notInService' or 'notReady', depending
                      on whether it has sufficient information to make
                      the conceptual row available for use by the
                      managed device.  If there is sufficient
                      information available, then the status column is
                      set to 'notInService'; otherwise, if there is
                      insufficient information, then the status column
                      is set to 'notReady'.  Regardless, we proceed to
                      interaction 3.


                      Interaction 3: Initializing non-defaulted Objects

                      The management station must now determine the
                      column requirements.  It issues a management
                      protocol get operation to examine all columns in
                      the created conceptual row.  In the response, for
                      each column, there are three possible outcomes:

                           - a value is returned, indicating that the
                           agent implements the object-type associated
                           with this column and had sufficient
                           information to provide a value.  For those
                           columns to which the agent provides read-
                           create access, a value return tells the
                           management station that it may issue
                           additional management protocol set
                           operations, if it desires, in order to change
                           the value associated with this column.

                           - the exception 'noSuchInstance' is returned,
                           indicating that the agent implements the
                           object-type associated with this column, and
                           that this column in at least one conceptual
                           row would be accessible in the MIB view used
                           by the retrieval were it to exist. However,
                           the agent does not have sufficient
                           information to provide a value, and until a
                           value is provided, the conceptual row may not
                           be made available for use by the managed
                           device.  For those columns to which the agent
                           provides read-create access, the
                           'noSuchInstance' exception tells the
                           management station that it must issue
                           additional management protocol set
                           operations, in order to provide a value
                           associated with this column.

                           - the exception 'noSuchObject' is returned,
                           indicating that the agent does not implement
                           the object-type associated with this column
                           or that there is no conceptual row for which
                           this column would be accessible in the MIB
                           view used by the retrieval.  As such, the
                           management station can not issue any
                           management protocol set operations to create


                           an instance of this column.

                      If the value associated with the status column is
                      'notReady', then the management station must first
                      deal with all 'noSuchInstance' columns, if any.
                      Having done so, the value of the status column
                      becomes 'notInService', and we proceed to
                      interaction 4.

                      Interaction 4: Making the Conceptual Row Available

                      Once the management station is satisfied with the
                      values associated with the columns of the
                      conceptual row, it issues a management protocol
                      set operation to set the status column to
                      'active'.  If the agent has sufficient information
                      to make the conceptual row available for use by
                      the managed device, the management protocol set
                      operation succeeds (a 'noError' response is
                      returned).  Otherwise, the management protocol set
                      operation fails with an error of
                      'inconsistentValue'.

                                          NOTE WELL

                           A conceptual row having a status column with
                           value 'notInService' or 'notReady' is
                           unavailable to the managed device.  As such,
                           it is possible for the managed device to
                           create its own instances during the time
                           between the management protocol set operation
                           which sets the status column to
                           'createAndWait' and the management protocol
                           set operation which sets the status column to
                           'active'.  In this case, when the management
                           protocol set operation is issued to set the
                           status column to 'active', the values held in
                           the agent supersede those used by the managed
                           device.

                      If the management station is prevented from
                      setting the status column to 'active' (e.g., due
                      to management station or network failure) the
                      conceptual row will be left in the 'notInService'
                      or 'notReady' state, consuming resources


                      indefinitely.  The agent must detect conceptual
                      rows that have been in either state for an
                      abnormally long period of time and remove them.
                      This period of time should be long enough to allow
                      for human response time (including 'think time')
                      between the creation of the conceptual row and the
                      setting of the status to 'active'.  It is
                      suggested that this period be approximately 5
                      minutes in length.

                                  Conceptual Row Suspension

                      When a conceptual row is 'active', the management
                      station may issue a management protocol set
                      operation which sets the instance of the status
                      column to 'notInService'.  If the agent is
                      unwilling to do so, the set operation fails with
                      an error of 'wrongValue'.  Otherwise, the
                      conceptual row is taken out of service, and a
                      'noError' response is returned.  It is the
                      responsibility of the the DESCRIPTION clause of
                      the status column to indicate under what
                      circumstances the status column should be taken
                      out of service (e.g., in order for the value of
                      some other column of the same conceptual row to be
                      modified).

                                   Conceptual Row Deletion

                      For deletion of conceptual rows, a management
                      protocol set operation is issued which sets the
                      instance of the status column to 'destroy'.  This
                      request may be made regardless of the current
                      value of the status column (e.g., it is possible
                      to delete conceptual rows which are either
                      'notReady', 'notInService' or 'active'.) If the
                      operation succeeds, then all instances associated
                      with the conceptual row are immediately removed."

                      known to this SNMPv2 entity.

                      Each SNMPv2 context which is locally accessible
                      has a single MIB view which is defined by two
                      collections of view subtrees: the included view
                      subtrees, and the excluded view subtrees.  Every
                      such subtree, both included and excluded, is
                      defined in this table.

                      To determine if a particular object instance is in
                      a particular MIB view, compare the object
                      instance's OBJECT IDENTIFIER with each of the MIB
                      view's entries in this table.  If none match, then
                      the object instance is not in the MIB view.  If
                      one or more match, then the object instance is
                      included in, or excluded from, the MIB view
                      according to the value of viewType in the entry
                      whose value of viewSubtree has the most sub-
                      identifiers.  If multiple entries match and have
                      the same number of sub-identifiers, then the
                      lexicographically greatest instance of viewType
                      determines the inclusion or exclusion.

                      An object instance's OBJECT IDENTIFIER X matches
                      an entry in this table when the number of sub-
                      identifiers in X is at least as many as in the
                      value of viewSubtree for the entry, and each sub-
                      identifier in the value of viewSubtree matches its
                      corresponding sub-identifier in X.  Two sub-
                      identifiers match either if the corresponding bit
                      of viewMask is zero (the 'wild card' value), or if
                      they are equal.

                      Due to this 'wild card' capability, we introduce


                      the term, a 'family' of view subtrees, to refer to
                      the set of subtrees defined by a particular
                      combination of values of viewSubtree and viewMask.
                      In the case where no 'wild card' is defined in
                      viewMask, the family of view subtrees reduces to a
                      single view subtree."

              DESCRIPTION
                      "The bit mask which, in combination with the
                      corresponding instance of viewSubtree, defines a
                      family of view subtrees.

                      Each bit of this bit mask corresponds to a sub-
                      identifier of viewSubtree, with the most
                      significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet
                      string value (extended if necessary, see below)
                      corresponding to the (8*i - 7)-th sub-identifier,
                      and the least significant bit of the i-th octet of
                      this octet string corresponding to the (8*i)-th
                      sub-identifier, where i is in the range 1 through
                      16.

                      Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not
                      the corresponding sub-identifiers must match when
                      determining if an OBJECT IDENTIFIER is in this
                      family of view subtrees; a '1' indicates that an
                      exact match must occur; a '0' indicates 'wild
                      card', i.e., any sub-identifier value matches.


                      Thus, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER X of an object
                      instance is contained in a family of view subtrees
                      if the following criteria are met:

                           for each sub-identifier of the value of
                           viewSubtree, either:

                                the i-th bit of viewMask is 0, or

                                the i-th sub-identifier of X is equal to
                                the i-th sub-identifier of the value of
                                viewSubtree.

                      If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and
                      there are more than M sub-identifiers in the
                      corresponding instance of viewSubtree, then the
                      bit mask is extended with 1's to be the required
                      length.

                      Note that when the value of this object is the
                      zero-length string, this extension rule results in
                      a mask of all-1's being used (i.e., no 'wild
                      card'), and the family of view subtrees is the one
                      view subtree uniquely identified by the
                      corresponding instance of viewSubtree."

          --
          -- This function has a hysteresis mechanism to limit the
          -- generation of events.  This mechanism generates one event
          -- as a threshold is crossed in the appropriate direction.  No
          -- more events are generated for that threshold until the
          -- opposite threshold is crossed.

          -- In the case of sampling a deltaValue, an entity may
          -- implement this mechanism with more precision if it takes a
          -- delta sample twice per period, each time comparing the sum

          -- the detection of threshold crossings that span the sampling

                  Because the counters in a bucket may overflow at their

                  will take into account the possibility of overflow

                  to consider the minimum time in which any counter
                  could overflow on a particular media type and set
                  the historyControlInterval object to a value less

          -- short of resources, it may delete entries as needed.  It
          -- is suggested that the device delete the least recently
          -- used entries first.

          -- The hostTable contains entries for each address
          -- discovered on a particular interface.  Each entry
          -- contains statistical data about that host.  This table

          -- indexed using hostTimeCreationOrder rather than hostAddress.
          -- The hostTimeCreationOrder is an integer which reflects
          -- the relative order in which a particular entry was


          -- discovered and thus inserted into the table.  As this

          -- if an (earlier) entry is deleted.  Thus the association
          -- between hostTimeCreationOrder and hostTimeEntry may be
          -- broken at any time.

          -- The hostTimeTable has two important uses.  The first is the
          -- fast download of this potentially large table.  Because the
          -- index of this table runs from 1 to the size of the table,
          -- inclusive, its values are predictable.  This allows very
          -- efficient packing of variables into SNMP PDU's and allows
          -- a table transfer to have multiple packets outstanding.
          -- These benefits increase transfer rates tremendously.

          -- The second use of the hostTimeTable is the efficient
          -- discovery by the management station of new entries added
          -- to the table.  After the management station has
          -- downloaded the entire table, it knows that new entries
          -- will be added immediately after the end of the current
          -- table.  It can thus detect new entries there
          -- and retrieve them easily.

          -- Because the association between hostTimeCreationOrder and
          -- hostTimeEntry may be broken at any time, the management
          -- station must monitor the related hostControlLastDeleteTime
          -- object.  When the management station thus detects a deletion,
          -- it must assume that any such associations have been broken,
          -- and invalidate any it has stored locally.  This includes
          -- restarting any download of the hostTimeTable that may have
          -- been in progress, as well as rediscovering the end of the

              STATUS mandatory
              DESCRIPTION
                  "The status that is to be matched with the input
                  packet.  The only bits relevant to this match
                  algorithm are those that have the corresponding
                  filterPktStatusMask bit equal to one.

                  The following two rules are then applied to every
                  packet:

                  (1) For each relevant bit from the packet status
                      with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask
                      bit set to zero, if the bit from the packet
                      status is not equal to the corresponding bit
                      from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will


                      fail this status match.

                  (2) If for every relevant bit from the packet status
                      with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask
                      bit set to one, the bit from the packet status
                      is equal to the corresponding bit from the
                      filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail
                      this status match.

                  Any packets that have not failed either of the two
                  matches above have passed this status match.

                  The value of the packet status is a sum.  This sum
                  initially takes the value zero.  Then, for each
                  error, E, that has been discovered in this packet,
                  2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum.
                  The errors and the bits that represent them are
                  dependent on the media type of the interface that
                  this channel is receiving packets from.

                  The errors defined for a packet captured off of an
                  Ethernet interface are as follows:

                      bit #    Error
                          0    Packet is longer than 1518 octets
                          1    Packet is shorter than 64 octets
                          2    Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment
                               error

                  For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a
                  value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2).

                  As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this
                  object will have other media-specific errors defined.

                  For the purposes of this status matching algorithm, if
                  the packet status is longer than this
                  object, filterPktStatus this object is conceptually
                  extended with '0' bits until it reaches the size of
                  the packet status.

                  packet.

                  The value of this object is defined in the same way as
                  filterPacketStatus.  The value is a sum.  This sum
                  initially takes the value zero.  Then, for each
                  error, E, that has been discovered in this packet,
                  2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum.

                  The errors defined for a packet captured off of an
                  Ethernet interface are as follows:

                      bit #    Error
                          0    Packet is longer than 1518 octets
                          1    Packet is shorter than 64 octets
                          2    Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment
                               error

                               it was detected that some packets were
                               not processed correctly.

                  For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a
                  value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2).

                  As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object

          -- The Event group controls the generation and notification
          -- of events from this device.  Each entry in the eventTable
          -- describes the parameters of the event that can be triggered.
          -- Each event entry is fired by an associated condition located
          -- elsewhere in the MIB.  An event entry may also be associated
          -- with a function elsewhere in the MIB that will be executed
          -- when the event is generated.  For example, a channel may
          -- be turned on or off by the firing of an event.
          --
          -- Each eventEntry may optionally specify that a log entry


          -- be created on its behalf whenever the event occurs.
          -- Each entry may also specify that notification should
          -- occur by way of SNMP trap messages.  In this case, the
          -- community for the trap message is given in the associated
          -- eventCommunity object.  The enterprise and specific trap
          -- fields of the trap are determined by the condition that
          -- triggered the event.  Three traps are defined in a companion
          -- document: risingAlarm, fallingAlarm, and packetMatch.
          -- If the eventTable is triggered by a condition specified
          -- elsewhere, the enterprise and specific trap fields
          -- must be specified for traps generated for that condition.
