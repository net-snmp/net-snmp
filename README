INTRODUCTION

  This package was originally based on the CMU 2.1.2.1 snmp code.  It
  has been greatly modified, restructured, enhanced and fixed.  It
  hardly looks the same at all as anything that CMU has ever
  released.  However, it maintains all the original API functions for
  complete backwards compatibility.

SUPPORTED ARCHITECTURES

  Please see the FAQ for this information.

  Please let us know if you compile it on other OS versions and it
  works for you so we can add them to the above list.

  Porting:  Please! read the PORTING file.

HELPING OUT

  This is a project worked on by people around the net.  We'd love
  your help, but please read the PORTING file first.

CODE UPDATE ANNOUNCEMENTS / MAILING LIST(S)

  See the NEWS file and the ChangeLog file for details on what has
  changed between releases.

  We hate broadcasting announce messages to other mailing lists and
  newsgroups, so there is a mailing list set up to handle release
  announcements.  Any time we put new software out for ftp, we'll mail
  this fact to ucd-snmp-announce@ece.ucdavis.edu.  To
  subscribe/unsubscribe yourself to/from this list, mail a note to
  ucd-snmp-announce-request@ece.ucdavis.edu with a subject line of
  'subscribe' or 'unsubscribe'.  We will post new announcements on a
  very infrequent basis to the other channels (the snmp mailing lists
  and comp.protocols.snmp), but only for major code revisions and not
  for bug-fix patches or small feature upgrades.

  The above mailing list is not a general purpose discussion list.  A
  separate list has been created for that purpose.  To subscribe to
  it, mail a note to ucd-snmp-request@ece.ucdavis.edu with a
  subject line of 'subscribe' or 'unsubscribe'.  To use it, mail to 
  ucd-snmp@ece.ucdavis.edu.

  In addition, there is yet another mailing list called
  ucd-snmp-coders@ece.ucdavis.edu, which is where all bug reports,
  questions and patches should be sent to.  The traffic volume is a
  lot higher and is really only of interest to those who intend to
  work on the code and submit patches frequently.  To join it, mail a
  "subscribe" request to ucd-snmp-coders-request@ece.ucdavis.edu.

  The archives for these mailing lists can be found at
  http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/ucd-snmp.

EXTENSIBILITY

  The agent that comes with this package is extensible through use of
  shell scripts and other methods.  See the configuration manual pages
  (snmpd.conf) and the EXAMPLE.conf file for details.

  You can also extend the agent by writing C code directly.  The agent
  is extremely modular in nature and you need only create new files,
  re-run configure and re-compile.  No modification of the distributed
  source files are necessary.  See the following files in the
  agent/mibgroup directory for details: README, wombat.c, wombat.h,
  example.c, example.h.

  Note:  This agent uses its own API for extensibility.  The IETF's
  agentx working group is working on developing a common API for
  subagent extensibility.  When they have finished the development of
  their specifications, we will begin working on implementing them.

EXAMPLE USAGE 

  See the 'EXAMPLE.conf' file in the top level source directory (you
  must build the package for this file to be generated).  Do NOT look
  at the EXAMPLE.conf.def file.  It will only confuse you.

CONFIGURATION

  See man/snmpd.conf.5 and the EXAMPLE.conf file mentioned above.

SUBMITTING BUG REPORTS

  The best way to submit a bug report is to use the enclosed
  "bug-report" script.  Please run the script on the architecture you
  are having problems with, as it automatically mails us with uname
  output for our usage.

  Please submit all bug reports and patches to
  ucd-snmp-coders@ece.ucdavis.edu.  *Please* include what version of
  the ucd-snmp package you are using and what architecture(s) you're
  using, as well as detailed information about exactly what is wrong.
  If you intend to submit a patch as well, please read the PORTING
  file before you do so.  Thanks!

CLOSING

  We love patches.  Send some to us!  But before you do, please see
  the 'PORTING' file for information on helping us out with the
  process of integrating your patches (regardless of weather its a new 
  feature implementation or a new port).

  Also, We're interested if anyone actually uses/likes/hates/whatever
  this package...  Mail us a note and let us know what you think of it!

  Have fun and may it make your life easier,
