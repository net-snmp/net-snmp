Bug Reports
</p>

<p>The <a href="/bugs/">SourceForge bug database</a> is used to report bugs in Net-SNMP or UCD-SNMP.</p>

<p>Before reporting a bug, please search the <a href="/bugs/">SourceForge bug database</a> and the <a href="/patches/">SourceForge patch database</a> to see if the bug has already been reported or fixed.</p>

<p>When posting a bug, please be sure to provide at a minimum, the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The version of Net-SNMP / UCD-SNMP used.  If you are using the CVS version, be sure to include the date the source was downloaded.</li>
  <li>The operating system version (eg: output from 'uname -a').</li>
  <li>If applicable, the operating system distribution (eg: SuSE Linux 9.1)</li>
  <li>Sample output demonstrating the bug.</li>
  <li>Detailed steps on how to reproduce the problem including exact commands used.</li>
  <li>If other libraries are involved such as OpenSSL, include the
  library version.</li>
  <li>If possible a stack trace (see below) if it had crashed</li>
</ul>

<h3> Submitting a stack trace </h3>

<p> When your agent, snmptrapd or application crashes here are
instructions for submitting a stack trace using GDB which will greatly
help us debug the problem. </p>

    <ul>
      <li> First, you either need to be able to reproduce it or have a core
	file as a result of the crash.  You either need to call gdb
	appropriately depending on which you have:
	<ul>
	  <li> With a core file:
	    <ol>
	      <li> % <b>gdb <i>/path/to/ProgramThatCrashed</i> <i>corefile</i></b> </li>
	    </ol>
	    After this a bunch of gdb lines will go by, ending in a
	    <i>"gdb&gt;"</i> prompt.
	  </li>
	  <li> Reproducing it the next time inside GDB:
	    <ol>
	      <li> % <b>gdb <i>/path/to/ProgramThatCrashed</i></b></li>
	      <li> <i> [wait for the <i>"gdb&gt;</i> prompt...]</i></li>
              <li> gdb&gt; <b>run <i>ARGUMENTS-TO-THE-PROGRAM</i></b></li>
	      <li> <i> [Get program to crash now...]</i></li>
	    </ol>
	    <p>Use whatever program arguments you used when getting it
	    to crash the first time.  For daemons like snmpd and
	    snmptrapd, be sure to include the -f flag to get it to not
	    fork into the background though.</p>
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li> Once you're program is at the stopping point, the most
      useful thing you can do to us the results of the "where" and
      "list" commands:
	<ul>
	  <li> gdb&gt; <b>where</b></li>
          <li> <i>[stack trace sent to your screen.  Include it in the
          bug report]</i></li>
	  <li> gdb&gt; <b>list</b></li>
          <li> <i>[source code listing may be shown.  Include it too
          if possible.]</i></li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
