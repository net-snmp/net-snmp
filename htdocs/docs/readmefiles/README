INTRODUCTION

  This package was originally based on the CMU 2.1.2.1 snmp code.  It
  has been greatly modified, restructured, enhanced and fixed.  It
  hardly looks the same as anything that CMU has ever released.  It
  was renamed from cmu-snmp to ucd-snmp in 1995 and later renamed from
  ucd-snmp to net-snmp in November 2000.

  This README file serves as a starting place to learn about the
  package, but very little of the documentation is contained within
  this file.  The FAQ is an excellent place to start as well.
  Additionally, there are a bunch of README files for specific
  architectures and specific features.  You might wish to look at some
  of these other files as well.

SUPPORTED ARCHITECTURES

  Please see the FAQ for this information.

  Please let us know if you compile it on other OS versions and it
  works for you so we can add them to the above list.

  Porting:  Please! read the PORTING file.

  Also note that many architecture have architecture specific README
  files, so you should check to see if there is one appropriate to
  your platform.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

  See the FAQ file distributed with this package.
  This is also available on the project Wiki at

     http://www.net-snmp.org/wiki/index.php/FAQ

  so that the wider Net-SNMP community can help maintain it!

HELPING OUT

  This is a project worked on by people around the net.  We'd love
  your help, but please read the PORTING file first.  Also, subscribe
  to the net-snmp-coders list described below and mention what you're
  going to work on to make sure no one else is already doing so!
  You'll also need to keep up to date with the latest code snap shot,
  which can be obtained from CVS using the information found at
  http://www.net-snmp.org/cvs/.

  Contributions to the Net-SNMP source code in any form are greatly
  appreciated.  We expect the parties providing such contributions to
  have the right to contribute them to the Net-SNMP project or that
  the parties that do have the right have directed the person
  submitting the contribution to do so.  In addition, all contributors
  need to be aware that if the contribution is accepted and
  incorporated into the Net-SNMP project, it will be redistributed
  under the terms of the license agreement used for the entire body of
  work that comprises the Net-SNMP project (see the COPYING file for
  details).  If this license agreement ever changes the contribution
  will continue to be released under any new licenses as well.  Thank
  you, in advance, for your gracious contributions.

CODE UPDATE ANNOUNCEMENTS

  See the NEWS file and the ChangeLog file for details on what has
  changed between releases.

  We hate broadcasting announce messages to other mailing lists and
  newsgroups, so there is a mailing list set up to handle release
  announcements.  Any time we put new software out for ftp, we'll mail
  this fact to net-snmp-announce@lists.sourceforge.net.  See the
  MAILING LISTS section described below to sign up for these
  announcements.

  We will post new announcements on a very infrequent basis to the
  other channels (the other snmp mailing lists and newsgroups like
  comp.protocols.snmp), but only for major code revisions and not for
  bug-fix patches or small feature upgrades.

MAILING LISTS

  The lists:

    A number of mailing lists have been created for support of the project:
    The main ones are:

      net-snmp-announce@lists.sourceforge.net  -- For official announcements
      net-snmp-users@lists.sourceforge.net     -- For usage discussions
      net-snmp-coders@lists.sourceforge.net    -- For development discussions

    The -coders list is intended for discussion on development of code
    that will be shipped as part of the package.  The -users list is
    for general discussion on configuring and using the package,
    including issues with coding user-developed applications (clients,
    managers, MIB modules, etc).

    Please do *NOT* send messages to both -users and -coders lists.
    This is completely unnecessary, and simply serves to further
    overload (and annoy) the core development team.   If in doubt,
    just use the -users list.


    The other lists of possible interest are:

      net-snmp-cvs@lists.sourceforge.net       -- For cvs update announcements
      net-snmp-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net      -- For Bug database update announcements
      net-snmp-patches@lists.sourceforge.net   -- For Patch database update announcements

    Please do NOT post messages to these lists (or to the announce list above).
    Bug reports and Patches should be submitted via the Source Forge tracker
    system.  See the main project web pages for details.

    To subscribe to any of these lists, please see:
  
      http://www.net-snmp.org/lists/

AGENT EXTENSIBILITY

  The agent that comes with this package is extensible through use of
  shell scripts and other methods.  See the configuration manual pages
  (like snmpd.conf) and run the snmpconf perl script for further details.

  You can also extend the agent by writing C code directly.  The agent
  is extremely modular in nature and you need only create new files,
  re-run configure and re-compile (or link against its libraries).  No
  modification of the distributed source files are necessary.  See the
  following files for details on how to go about this:
  http://www.net-snmp.org/tutorial-5/toolkit/,
  agent/mibgroup/examples/*.c

  Also, see the local/mib2c program and its README file for help in
  turning a textual mib description into a C code template.

  We now support AgentX for subagent extensibility.  The net-snmp
  agent can run as both a master agent and a subagent.  Additionally,
  a toolkit is provided that enables users of it to easily embed a
  agentx client into external applications.  See the tutorial at
  http://www.net-snmp.org/tutorial-5/toolkit/ for an example of how
  go about doing this.

CONFIGURATION

  See the man/snmp.conf.5 manual page.

  For the agent, additionally see the man/snmpd.conf.5 manual page.

  For the snmptrapd, see the man/snmptrapd.conf.5 manual page.

  You can also run the snmpconf perl script to help you create some of
  these files.

SUBMITTING BUG REPORTS

  Important: *Please* include what version of the net-snmp (or
  ucd-snmp) package you are using and what architecture(s) you're
  using, as well as detailed information about exactly what is wrong.

  To submit a bug report, please use the web interface at
  http://www.net-snmp.org/bugs/.  It is a full-fledged
  bug-tracking system that will allow you to search for already
  existing bug reports as well as track the status of your report as
  it is processed by the core developers.

  If you intend to submit a patch as well, please read the PORTING
  file before you do so and then submit it to
  http://www.net-snmp.org/patches/.

CLOSING

  We love patches.  Send some to us!  But before you do, please see
  the 'PORTING' file for information on helping us out with the
  process of integrating your patches (regardless of whether its a new
  feature implementation or a new port).

  Also, We're interested if anyone actually uses/likes/hates/whatever
  this package...  Mail us a note and let us know what you think of it!

  Have fun and may it make your life easier,

    The net-snmp developers
