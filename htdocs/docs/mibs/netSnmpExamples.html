<pre>
This is a simple object which is a basic integer.  It's value
indicates the number of seconds that the agent will take in
responding to requests of this object.  This is implemented
in a way which will allow the agent to keep responding to
other requests while access to this object is blocked.  It is
writable, and changing it's value will change the amount of
time the agent will effectively wait for before returning a
response when this object is manipulated.  Note that SET
requests through this object will take longer, since the
delay is applied to each internal transaction phase, which
could result in delays of up to 4 times the value of this
object.

This example object is implemented in the
agent/mibgroup/examples/delayed_instance.c file.

<h2>TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS</h2>
<ul>
<p>
These TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS are used in other parts of the document
above.  They are SNMP's way of defining a datatype that is used
repeatedly by other MIB objects.  Any implementation implementing
objects that use one of these definitions must follow its DESCRIPTION
clause as well as the DESCRIPTION clause of the object itself.

A
row which is volatile(2) is lost upon reboot.  A row which
is either nonVolatile(3), permanent(4) or readOnly(5), is
backed up by stable storage.  A row which is permanent(4)
can be changed but not deleted.  A row which is readOnly(5)
cannot be changed nor deleted.

If the value of an object with this syntax is either
permanent(4) or readOnly(5), it cannot be written.
Conversely, if the value is either other(1), volatile(2) or
nonVolatile(3), it cannot be modified to be permanent(4) or
readOnly(5).  (All illegal modifications result in a
'wrongValue' error.)

Every usage of this textual convention is required to
specify the columnar objects which a permanent(4) row must
at a minimum allow to be writable.</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="InetAddress">InetAddress</td><td>OCTETSTR</td><td><pre>Denotes a generic Internet address.
An InetAddress value is always interpreted within the context
         of an InetAddressType value.  Every usage of the InetAddress
         textual convention is required to specify the InetAddressType
         object that provides the context.  It is suggested that the
         InetAddressType object be logically registered before the
         object(s) that use the InetAddress textual convention, if
         they appear in the same logical row.
The value of an InetAddress object must always be
         consistent with the value of the associated InetAddressType
         object.  Attempts to set an InetAddress object to a value
         inconsistent with the associated InetAddressType
         must fail with an inconsistentValue error.
When this textual convention is used as the syntax of an
         index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128
         sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2, STD 58.  In this case,
         the object definition MUST include a 'SIZE' clause to
         limit the number of potential instance sub-identifiers;
         otherwise the applicable constraints MUST be stated in
         the appropriate conceptual row DESCRIPTION clauses, or
         in the surrounding documentation if there is no single
         DESCRIPTION clause that is appropriate.</pre></td></tr>

unknown(0)  An unknown address type.  This value MUST
                     be used if the value of the corresponding
                     InetAddress object is a zero-length string.
                     It may also be used to indicate an IP address
                     that is not in one of the formats defined
                     below.
ipv4(1)     An IPv4 address as defined by the
                     InetAddressIPv4 textual convention.
ipv6(2)     An IPv6 address as defined by the
                     InetAddressIPv6 textual convention.
ipv4z(3)    A non-global IPv4 address including a zone
                     index as defined by the InetAddressIPv4z
                     textual convention.
ipv6z(4)    A non-global IPv6 address including a zone
                     index as defined by the InetAddressIPv6z
                     textual convention.
dns(16)     A DNS domain name as defined by the
                     InetAddressDNS textual convention.
Each definition of a concrete InetAddressType value must be
         accompanied by a definition of a textual convention for use
         with that InetAddressType.
To support future extensions, the InetAddressType textual
         convention SHOULD NOT be sub-typed in object type definitions.
         It MAY be sub-typed in compliance statements in order to
         require only a subset of these address types for a compliant
         implementation.
Implementations must ensure that InetAddressType objects
         and any dependent objects (e.g., InetAddress objects) are
         consistent.  An inconsistentValue error must be generated
         if an attempt to change an InetAddressType object would,
         for example, lead to an undefined InetAddress value.  In
particular, InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs must be
         changed together if the address type changes (e.g., from
         ipv6(2) to ipv4(1)).</pre></td></tr>

creation and deletion of conceptual rows, and is used as the
value of the SYNTAX clause for the status column of a
conceptual row (as described in Section 7.7.1 of [2].)

The status column has six defined values:

     - `active', which indicates that the conceptual row is
     available for use by the managed device;

     - `notInService', which indicates that the conceptual
     row exists in the agent, but is unavailable for use by
     the managed device (see NOTE below); 'notInService' has
     no implication regarding the internal consistency of
     the row, availability of resources, or consistency with
     the current state of the managed device;

     - `notReady', which indicates that the conceptual row
     exists in the agent, but is missing information
     necessary in order to be available for use by the
     managed device (i.e., one or more required columns in
     the conceptual row have not been instanciated);

     - `createAndGo', which is supplied by a management
     station wishing to create a new instance of a
     conceptual row and to have its status automatically set
     to active, making it available for use by the managed
     device;

     - `createAndWait', which is supplied by a management
     station wishing to create a new instance of a
     conceptual row (but not make it available for use by
     the managed device); and,
     - `destroy', which is supplied by a management station
     wishing to delete all of the instances associated with
     an existing conceptual row.

Whereas five of the six values (all except `notReady') may
be specified in a management protocol set operation, only
three values will be returned in response to a management
protocol retrieval operation:  `notReady', `notInService' or
`active'.  That is, when queried, an existing conceptual row
has only three states:  it is either available for use by
the managed device (the status column has value `active');
it is not available for use by the managed device, though
the agent has sufficient information to attempt to make it
so (the status column has value `notInService'); or, it is
not available for use by the managed device, and an attempt
to make it so would fail because the agent has insufficient
information (the state column has value `notReady').

                         NOTE WELL

     This textual convention may be used for a MIB table,
     irrespective of whether the values of that table's
     conceptual rows are able to be modified while it is
     active, or whether its conceptual rows must be taken
     out of service in order to be modified.  That is, it is
     the responsibility of the DESCRIPTION clause of the
     status column to specify whether the status column must
     not be `active' in order for the value of some other
     column of the same conceptual row to be modified.  If
     such a specification is made, affected columns may be
     changed by an SNMP set PDU if the RowStatus would not
     be equal to `active' either immediately before or after
     processing the PDU.  In other words, if the PDU also
     contained a varbind that would change the RowStatus
     value, the column in question may be changed if the
     RowStatus was not equal to `active' as the PDU was
     received, or if the varbind sets the status</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="SnmpAdminString">SnmpAdminString</td><td>OCTETSTR</td><td><pre>An octet string containing administrative
information, preferably in human-readable form.

To facilitate internationalization, this
information is represented using the ISO/IEC
IS 10646-1 character set, encoded as an octet
string using the UTF-8 transformation format
described in [RFC2279].

Since additional code points are added by
amendments to the 10646 standard from time
to time, implementations must be prepared to
encounter any code point from 0x00000000 to
0x7fffffff.  Byte sequences that do not
correspond to the valid UTF-8 encoding of a
code point or are outside this range are
prohibited.

The use of control codes should be avoided.

When it is necessary to represent a newline,
the control code sequence CR LF should be used.

The use of leading or trailing white space should
be avoided.

For code points not directly supported by user
interface hardware or software, an alternative
means of entry and display, such as hexadecimal,
may be provided.

For information encoded in 7-bit US-ASCII,
the UTF-8 encoding is identical to the
US-ASCII encoding.

UTF-8 may require multiple bytes to represent a
single character / code point; thus the length
of this object in octets may be different from
the number of characters encoded.  Similarly,
size constraints refer to the number of encoded
octets, not the number of characters represented
by an encoding.

Note that when this TC is used for an object that
is used or envisioned to be used as an index, then
a SIZE restriction MUST be specified so that the
number of sub-identifiers for any object instance
does not exceed the limit of 128, as defined by
[RFC3416].

Note that the size of an SnmpAdminString object is
measured in octets, not characters.
