<pre>
The table of users configured in the SNMP engine's
Local Configuration Datastore (LCD).

To create a new user (i.e., to instantiate a new
conceptual row in this table), it is recommended to
follow this procedure:

  1)  GET(usmUserSpinLock.0) and save in sValue.

  2)  SET(usmUserSpinLock.0=sValue,
          usmUserCloneFrom=templateUser,
          usmUserStatus=createAndWait)
      You should use a template user to clone from
      which has the proper auth/priv protocol defined.

If the new user is to use privacy:

  3)  generate the keyChange value based on the secret
      privKey of the clone-from user and the secret key
      to be used for the new user. Let us call this
      pkcValue.
  4)  GET(usmUserSpinLock.0) and save in sValue.
  5)  SET(usmUserSpinLock.0=sValue,
          usmUserPrivKeyChange=pkcValue
          usmUserPublic=randomValue1)
  6)  GET(usmUserPulic) and check it has randomValue1.
      If not, repeat steps 4-6.

If the new user will never use privacy:

  7)  SET(usmUserPrivProtocol=usmNoPrivProtocol)

If the new user is to use authentication:

  8)  generate the keyChange value based on the secret
      authKey of the clone-from user and the secret key
      to be used for the new user. Let us call this
      akcValue.
  9)  GET(usmUserSpinLock.0) and save in sValue.
  10) SET(usmUserSpinLock.0=sValue,
          usmUserAuthKeyChange=akcValue
          usmUserPublic=randomValue2)
  11) GET(usmUserPulic) and check it has randomValue2.
      If not, repeat steps 9-11.

If the new user will never use authentication:

  12) SET(usmUserAuthProtocol=usmNoAuthProtocol)

Finally, activate the new user:

  13) SET(usmUserStatus=active)

The new user should now be available and ready to be
used for SNMPv3 communication. Note however that access
to MIB data must be provided via configuration of the
SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB.

The use of usmUserSpinlock is to avoid conflicts with
another SNMP command generator application which may
also be acting on the usmUserTable.

<pre>
A pointer to another conceptual row in this
usmUserTable.  The user in this other conceptual
row is called the clone-from user.

When a new user is created (i.e., a new conceptual
row is instantiated in this table), the privacy and
authentication parameters of the new user must be
cloned from its clone-from user. These parameters are:
  - authentication protocol (usmUserAuthProtocol)
  - privacy protocol (usmUserPrivProtocol)
They will be copied regardless of what the current
value is.

Cloning also causes the initial values of the secret
authentication key (authKey) and the secret encryption

key (privKey) of the new user to be set to the same
values as the corresponding secrets of the clone-from
user to allow the KeyChange process to occur as
required during user creation.

The first time an instance of this object is set by
a management operation (either at or after its
instantiation), the cloning process is invoked.
Subsequent writes are successful but invoke no
action to be taken by the receiver.
The cloning process fails with an 'inconsistentName'
error if the conceptual row representing the
clone-from user does not exist or is not in an active
state when the cloning process is invoked.

When this object is read, the ZeroDotZero OID
is returned.

<pre>
An indication of whether messages sent on behalf of
this user to/from the SNMP engine identified by
usmUserEngineID, can be authenticated, and if so,
the type of authentication protocol which is used.

An instance of this object is created concurrently
with the creation of any other object instance for
the same user (i.e., as part of the processing of
the set operation which creates the first object
instance in the same conceptual row).

If an initial set operation (i.e. at row creation time)
tries to set a value for an unknown or unsupported
protocol, then a 'wrongValue' error must be returned.

The value will be overwritten/set when a set operation
is performed on the corresponding instance of
usmUserCloneFrom.

Once instantiated, the value of such an instance of
this object can only be changed via a set operation to
the value of the usmNoAuthProtocol.

If a set operation tries to change the value of an

existing instance of this object to any value other
than usmNoAuthProtocol, then an 'inconsistentValue'
error must be returned.

If a set operation tries to set the value to the
usmNoAuthProtocol while the usmUserPrivProtocol value
in the same row is not equal to usmNoPrivProtocol,
then an 'inconsistentValue' error must be returned.
That means that an SNMP command generator application
must first ensure that the usmUserPrivProtocol is set
to the usmNoPrivProtocol value before it can set
the usmUserAuthProtocol value to usmNoAuthProtocol.

<pre>
An object, which when modified, causes the secret
authentication key used for messages sent on behalf
of this user to/from the SNMP engine identified by
usmUserEngineID, to be modified via a one-way
function.

The associated protocol is the usmUserAuthProtocol.
The associated secret key is the user's secret
authentication key (authKey). The associated hash
algorithm is the algorithm used by the user's
usmUserAuthProtocol.

When creating a new user, it is an 'inconsistentName'
error for a set operation to refer to this object
unless it is previously or concurrently initialized
through a set operation on the corresponding instance
of usmUserCloneFrom.

When the value of the corresponding usmUserAuthProtocol
is usmNoAuthProtocol, then a set is successful, but
effectively is a no-op.

When this object is read, the zero-length (empty)
string is returned.

The recommended way to do a key change is as follows:

  1) GET(usmUserSpinLock.0) and save in sValue.
  2) generate the keyChange value based on the old
     (existing) secret key and the new secret key,
     let us call this kcValue.

If you do the key change on behalf of another user:

  3) SET(usmUserSpinLock.0=sValue,
         usmUserAuthKeyChange=kcValue
         usmUserPublic=randomValue)

If you do the key change for yourself:

  4) SET(usmUserSpinLock.0=sValue,
         usmUserOwnAuthKeyChange=kcValue
         usmUserPublic=randomValue)

If you get a response with error-status of noError,
then the SET succeeded and the new key is active.
If you do not get a response, then you can issue a
GET(usmUserPublic) and check if the value is equal
to the randomValue you did send in the SET. If so, then
the key change succeeded and the new key is active
(probably the response got lost). If not, then the SET
request probably never reached the target and so you
can start over with the procedure above.

Behaves exactly as usmUserAuthKeyChange, with one
notable difference: in order for the set operation
to succeed, the usmUserName of the operation
requester must match the usmUserName that
indexes the row which is targeted by this
operation.
In addition, the USM security model must be
used for this operation.

The idea here is that access to this column can be
public, since it will only allow a user to change
his own secret authentication key (authKey).
Note that this can only be done once the row is active.

When a set is received and the usmUserName of the
requester is not the same as the umsUserName that
indexes the row which is targeted by this operation,
then a 'noAccess' error must be returned.

When a set is received and the security model in use
is not USM, then a 'noAccess' error must be returned.

An indication of whether messages sent on behalf of
this user to/from the SNMP engine identified by
usmUserEngineID, can be protected from disclosure,

An instance of this object is created concurrently
with the creation of any other object instance for
the same user (i.e., as part of the processing of
the set operation which creates the first object
instance in the same conceptual row).

If an initial set operation (i.e. at row creation time)

If a set operation tries to change the value of an
existing instance of this object to any value other
than usmNoPrivProtocol, then an 'inconsistentValue'
error must be returned.

Note that if any privacy protocol is used, then you
must also use an authentication protocol. In other
words, if usmUserPrivProtocol is set to anything else
than usmNoPrivProtocol, then the corresponding instance
of usmUserAuthProtocol cannot have a value of

usmNoAuthProtocol. If it does, then an
'inconsistentValue' error must be returned.

The storage type for this conceptual row.
Conceptual rows having the value 'permanent' must
                 allow write-access at a minimum to:
- usmUserAuthKeyChange, usmUserOwnAuthKeyChange
                   and usmUserPublic for a user who employs
                   authentication, and

                   and usmUserPublic for a user who employs
                   privacy.
Note that any user who employs authentication or
                 privacy must allow its secret(s) to be updated and
                 thus cannot be 'readOnly'.
If an initial set operation tries to set the value to
                 'readOnly' for a user who employs authentication or
                 privacy, then an 'inconsistentValue' error must be

It is an implementation issue to decide if a SET for
                 a readOnly or permanent row is accepted at all. In some
                 contexts this may make sense, in others it may not. If

<h2>TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS</h2>
<ul>
<p>
These TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS are used in other parts of the document
above.  They are SNMP's way of defining a datatype that is used
repeatedly by other MIB objects.  Any implementation implementing
objects that use one of these definitions must follow its DESCRIPTION
clause as well as the DESCRIPTION clause of the object itself.

<tr><td><a name="KeyChange">KeyChange</td><td>OCTETSTR</td><td><pre>Every definition of an object with this syntax must identify
a protocol P, a secret key K, and a hash algorithm H
that produces output of L octets.

The object's value is a manager-generated, partially-random
value which, when modified, causes the value of the secret
key K, to be modified via a one-way function.

The value of an instance of this object is the concatenation
of two components: first a 'random' component and then a
'delta' component.

The lengths of the random and delta components
are given by the corresponding value of the protocol P;
if P requires K to be a fixed length, the length of both the
random and delta components is that fixed length; if P
allows the length of K to be variable up to a particular
maximum length, the length of the random component is that
maximum length and the length of the delta component is any
length less than or equal to that maximum length.
For example, usmHMACMD5AuthProtocol requires K to be a fixed
length of 16 octets and L - of 16 octets.
usmHMACSHAAuthProtocol requires K to be a fixed length of
20 octets and L - of 20 octets. Other protocols may define
other sizes, as deemed appropriate.

When a requester wants to change the old key K to a new
key keyNew on a remote entity, the 'random' component is
obtained from either a true random generator, or from a
pseudorandom generator, and the 'delta' component is
computed as follows:

 - a temporary variable is initialized to the existing value
   of K;
 - if the length of the keyNew is greater than L octets,
   then:
    - the random component is appended to the value of the
      temporary variable, and the result is input to the
      the hash algorithm H to produce a digest value, and
      the temporary variable is set to this digest value;
    - the value of the temporary variable is XOR-ed with
      the first (next) L-octets (16 octets in case of MD5)
      of the keyNew to produce the first (next) L-octets
      (16 octets in case of MD5) of the 'delta' component.
    - the above two steps are repeated until the unused
      portion of the keyNew component is L octets or less,
 - the random component is appended to the value of the
   temporary variable, and the result is input to the
   hash algorithm H to produce a digest value;
 - this digest value, truncated if necessary to be the same
   length as the unused portion of the keyNew, is XOR-ed
   with the unused portion of the keyNew to produce the
   (final portion of the) 'delta' component.

 For example, using MD5 as the hash algorithm H:

    iterations = (lenOfDelta - 1)/16; /* integer division */
    temp = keyOld;
    for (i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
        temp = MD5 (temp || random);
        delta[i*16 .. (i*16)+15] =
               temp XOR keyNew[i*16 .. (i*16)+15];
    }
    temp = MD5 (temp || random);
    delta[i*16 .. lenOfDelta-1] =
           temp XOR keyNew[i*16 .. lenOfDelta-1];

The 'random' and 'delta' components are then concatenated as
described above, and the resulting octet string is sent to
the recipient as the new value of an instance of this object.

At the receiver side, when an instance of this object is set
to a new value, then a new value of K is computed as follows:

 - a temporary variable is initialized to the existing value
   of K;
 - if the length of the delta component is greater than L
   octets, then:
    - the random component is appended to the value of th</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="TestAndIncr">TestAndIncr</td><td>INTEGER</td><td><pre>Represents integer-valued information used for atomic
operations.  When the management protocol is used to specify
that an object instance having this syntax is to be
modified, the new value supplied via the management protocol
must precisely match the value presently held by the
instance.  If not, the management protocol set operation
fails with an error of `inconsistentValue'.  Otherwise, if
the current value is the maximum value of 2^31-1 (2147483647
decimal), then the value held by the instance is wrapped to
zero; otherwise, the value held by the instance is
incremented by one.  (Note that regardless of whether the
management protocol set operation succeeds, the variable-
binding in the request and response PDUs are identical.)

The value of the ACCESS clause for objects having this
syntax is either `read-write' or `read-create'.  When an
instance of a columnar object having this syntax is created,
any value may be supplied via the management protocol.

When the network management portion of the system is re-
initialized, the value of every object instance having this
syntax must either be incremented from its value prior to
the re-initialization, or (if the value prior to the re-
initialization is unknown) be set to a pseudo-randomly
generated value.</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="AutonomousType">AutonomousType</td><td>OBJECTID</td><td><pre>Represents an independently extensible type identification
value.  It may, for example, indicate a particular sub-tree

<tr><td><a name="SnmpEngineID">SnmpEngineID</td><td>OCTETSTR</td><td><pre>An SNMP engine's administratively-unique identifier.
Objects of this type are for identification, not for
addressing, even though it is possible that an
address may have been used in the generation of
a specific value.

The value for this object may not be all zeros or
all 'ff'H or the empty (zero length) string.

The initial value for this object may be configured
via an operator console entry or via an algorithmic
function.  In the latter case, the following
example algorithm is recommended.

In cases where there are multiple engines on the
same system, the use of this algorithm is NOT
appropriate, as it would result in all of those
engines ending up with the same ID value.

1) The very first bit is used to indicate how the
   rest of the data is composed.

   0 - as defined by enterprise using former methods
       that existed before SNMPv3. See item 2 below.

   1 - as defined by this architecture, see item 3
       below.

   Note that this allows existing uses of the
   engineID (also known as AgentID [RFC1910]) to
   co-exist with any new uses.

2) The snmpEngineID has a length of 12 octets.

   The first four octets are set to the binary
   equivalent of the agent's SNMP management
   private enterprise number as assigned by the
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
   For example, if Acme Networks has been assigned
   { enterprises 696 }, the first four octets would
   be assigned '000002b8'H.

   The remaining eight octets are determined via
   one or more enterprise-specific methods. Such
   methods must be designed so as to maximize the
   possibility that the value of this object will
   be unique in the agent's administrative domain.
   For example, it may be the IP address of the SNMP
   entity, or the MAC address of one of the
   interfaces, with each address suitably padded
   with random octets.  If multiple methods are
   defined, then it is recommended that the first
   octet indicate the method being used and the
   remaining octets be a function of the method.

3) The length of the octet string varies.

   The first four octets are set to the binary
   equivalent of the agent's SNMP management
   private enterprise number as assigned by the
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
   For example, if Acme Networks has been assigned
   { enterprises 696 }, the first four octets would
   be assigned '000002b8'H.

   The very first bit is set to 1. For example, the
   above value for Acme Networks now changes to be
   '800002b8'H.

   The fifth octet indicates how the rest (6th and
   following octets) are formatted. The values for
   the fifth octet are:

     0     - reserved, unused.

     1     - IPv4 address (4 octets)
             lowest non-special IP address

     2     - IPv6 address (16 octets)
             lowest non-special IP address

     3     - MAC address (6 octets)

creation and deletion of conceptual rows, and is used as the
value of the SYNTAX clause for the status column of a
conceptual row (as described in Section 7.7.1 of [2].)

The status column has six defined values:

     - `active', which indicates that the conceptual row is
     available for use by the managed device;

     - `notInService', which indicates that the conceptual
     row exists in the agent, but is unavailable for use by
     the managed device (see NOTE below); 'notInService' has
     no implication regarding the internal consistency of
     the row, availability of resources, or consistency with
     the current state of the managed device;

     - `notReady', which indicates that the conceptual row
     exists in the agent, but is missing information
     necessary in order to be available for use by the
     managed device (i.e., one or more required columns in
     the conceptual row have not been instanciated);

     - `createAndGo', which is supplied by a management
     station wishing to create a new instance of a
     conceptual row and to have its status automatically set
     to active, making it available for use by the managed
     device;

     - `createAndWait', which is supplied by a management
     station wishing to create a new instance of a
     conceptual row (but not make it available for use by
     the managed device); and,
     - `destroy', which is supplied by a management station
     wishing to delete all of the instances associated with
     an existing conceptual row.

Whereas five of the six values (all except `notReady') may
be specified in a management protocol set operation, only
three values will be returned in response to a management
protocol retrieval operation:  `notReady', `notInService' or
`active'.  That is, when queried, an existing conceptual row
has only three states:  it is either available for use by
the managed device (the status column has value `active');
it is not available for use by the managed device, though
the agent has sufficient information to attempt to make it
so (the status column has value `notInService'); or, it is
not available for use by the managed device, and an attempt
to make it so would fail because the agent has insufficient
information (the state column has value `notReady').

                         NOTE WELL

     This textual convention may be used for a MIB table,
     irrespective of whether the values of that table's
     conceptual rows are able to be modified while it is
     active, or whether its conceptual rows must be taken
     out of service in order to be modified.  That is, it is
     the responsibility of the DESCRIPTION clause of the
     status column to specify whether the status column must
     not be `active' in order for the value of some other
     column of the same conceptual row to be modified.  If
     such a specification is made, affected columns may be
     changed by an SNMP set PDU if the RowStatus would not
     be equal to `active' either immediately before or after
     processing the PDU.  In other words, if the PDU also
     contained a varbind that would change the RowStatus
     value, the column in question may be changed if the
     RowStatus was not equal to `active' as the PDU was
     received, or if the varbind sets the status</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="SnmpAdminString">SnmpAdminString</td><td>OCTETSTR</td><td><pre>An octet string containing administrative
information, preferably in human-readable form.

To facilitate internationalization, this
information is represented using the ISO/IEC
IS 10646-1 character set, encoded as an octet
string using the UTF-8 transformation format
described in [RFC2279].

Since additional code points are added by
amendments to the 10646 standard from time
to time, implementations must be prepared to
encounter any code point from 0x00000000 to
0x7fffffff.  Byte sequences that do not
correspond to the valid UTF-8 encoding of a
code point or are outside this range are
prohibited.

The use of control codes should be avoided.

When it is necessary to represent a newline,
the control code sequence CR LF should be used.

The use of leading or trailing white space should
be avoided.

For code points not directly supported by user
interface hardware or software, an alternative
means of entry and display, such as hexadecimal,
may be provided.

For information encoded in 7-bit US-ASCII,
the UTF-8 encoding is identical to the
US-ASCII encoding.

UTF-8 may require multiple bytes to represent a
single character / code point; thus the length
of this object in octets may be different from
the number of characters encoded.  Similarly,
size constraints refer to the number of encoded
octets, not the number of characters represented
by an encoding.

Note that when this TC is used for an object that
is used or envisioned to be used as an index, then
a SIZE restriction MUST be specified so that the
number of sub-identifiers for any object instance
does not exceed the limit of 128, as defined by
[RFC3416].

Note that the size of an SnmpAdminString object is
measured in octets, not characters.
