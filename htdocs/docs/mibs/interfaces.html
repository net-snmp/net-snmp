or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this
object should contain the nominal bandwidth.  If the
bandwidth of the interface is greater than the maximum value
reportable by this object then this object should report its
maximum value (4,294,967,295) and ifHighSpeed must be used
to report the interace's speed.  For a sub-layer which has
no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.

The interface's address at its protocol sub-layer.  For
example, for an 802.x interface, this object normally
contains a MAC address.  The interface's media-specific MIB
must define the bit and byte ordering and the format of the
value of this object.  For interfaces which do not have such
an address (e.g., a serial line), this object should contain
an octet string of zero length.

The current operational state of the interface.  The
testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can

should be down(2).  If ifAdminStatus is changed to up(1)
then ifOperStatus should change to up(1) if the interface is
ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should
change to dormant(5) if the interface is waiting for
external actions (such as a serial line waiting for an
incoming connection); it should remain in the down(2) state
if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going
to the up(1) state; it should remain in the notPresent(6)
state if the interface has missing (typically, hardware)
components.

To summarize RFC 854, the NVT ASCII repertoire specifies:
  - the use of character codes 0-127 (decimal)
  - the graphics characters (32-126) are interpreted as
                US ASCII
  - NUL, LF, CR, BEL, BS, HT, VT and FF have the special
                meanings specified in RFC 854
  - the other 25 codes have no standard interpretation
  - the sequence 'CR LF' means newline
  - the sequence 'CR NUL' means carriage-return
  - an 'LF' not preceded by a 'CR' means moving to the
                same column on the next line.
  - the sequence 'CR x' for any x other than LF or NUL is
                illegal.  (Note that this also means that a string may

data type is used as the syntax of the ifType
object in the (updated) definition of MIB-II's
ifTable.

The definition of this textual convention with the
addition of newly assigned values is published
periodically by the IANA, in either the Assigned
Numbers RFC, or some derivative of it specific to
Internet Network Management number assignments.  (The
latest arrangements can be obtained by contacting the
IANA.)

Requests for new values should be made to IANA via
email (iana&iana.org).

The relationship between the assignment of ifType
values and of OIDs to particular media-specific MIBs
is solely the purview of IANA and is subject to change
without notice.  Quite often, a media-specific MIB's
OID-subtree assignment within MIB-II's 'transmission'
subtree will be the same as its ifType value.
However, in some circumstances this will not be the
case, and implementors must not pre-assume any
specific relationship between ifType values and
transmission subtree OIDs.</pre></td></tr>
