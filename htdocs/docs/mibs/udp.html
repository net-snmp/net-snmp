  <tr><td class="label">Table Description</td>
<td>
<pre>
A table containing information about this entity's UDP
endpoints on which a local application is currently
accepting or sending datagrams.

The address type in this table represents the address
type used for the communication, irrespective of the
higher-layer abstraction.  For example, an application
using IPv6 'sockets' to communicate via IPv4 between
::ffff:10.0.0.1 and ::ffff:10.0.0.2 would use
InetAddressType ipv4(1).

Unlike the udpTable in RFC 2013, this table also allows
the representation of an application that completely
specifies both local and remote addresses and ports.  A
listening application is represented in three possible
ways:

1) An application that is willing to accept both IPv4
   and IPv6 datagrams is represented by a
   udpEndpointLocalAddressType of unknown(0) and a
   udpEndpointLocalAddress of ''h (a zero-length
   octet-string).

2) An application that is willing to accept only IPv4
   or only IPv6 datagrams is represented by a
   udpEndpointLocalAddressType of the appropriate
   address type and a udpEndpointLocalAddress of
   '0.0.0.0' or '::' respectively.

3) An application that is listening for datagrams only
   for a specific IP address but from any remote
   system is represented by a
   udpEndpointLocalAddressType of the appropriate
   address type, with udpEndpointLocalAddress
   specifying the local address.

In all cases where the remote is a wildcard, the
udpEndpointRemoteAddressType is unknown(0), the
udpEndpointRemoteAddress is ''h (a zero-length
octet-string), and the udpEndpointRemotePort is 0.

If the operating system is demultiplexing UDP packets
by remote address and port, or if the application has
'connected' the socket specifying a default remote
address and port, the udpEndpointRemote* values should
be used to reflect this.

<pre>
The local IP address for this UDP endpoint.
The value of this object can be represented in three
possible ways, depending on the characteristics of the
            listening application:
1. For an application that is willing to accept both
               IPv4 and IPv6 datagrams, the value of this object
               must be ''h (a zero-length octet-string), with
               the value of the corresponding instance of the
               udpEndpointLocalAddressType object being unknown(0).
2. For an application that is willing to accept only IPv4
               or only IPv6 datagrams, the value of this object
               must be '0.0.0.0' or '::', respectively, while the
               corresponding instance of the
               udpEndpointLocalAddressType object represents the
               appropriate address type.
3. For an application that is listening for data
               destined only to a specific IP address, the value
               of this object is the specific IP address for which
               this node is receiving packets, with the
               corresponding instance of the
               udpEndpointLocalAddressType object representing the
               appropriate address type.
As this object is used in the index for the
            udpEndpointTable, implementors of this table should be
            careful not to create entries that would result in OIDs
            with more than 128 subidentifiers; else the information
            cannot be accessed using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.

unknown(0) if datagrams for all remote IP addresses are
accepted.  Also, note that some combinations of

udpEndpointLocalAdressType and
udpEndpointRemoteAddressType are not supported.  In
particular, if the value of this object is not
unknown(0), it is expected to always refer to the
same IP version as udpEndpointLocalAddressType.

<h2>TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS</h2>
<ul>
<p>
These TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS are used in other parts of the document
above.  They are SNMP's way of defining a datatype that is used
repeatedly by other MIB objects.  Any implementation implementing
objects that use one of these definitions must follow its DESCRIPTION
clause as well as the DESCRIPTION clause of the object itself.

layer protocol.  Port numbers are assigned by IANA.  A
         current list of all assignments is available from
         <http://www.iana.org/>.
The value zero is object-specific and must be defined as
         part of the description of any object that uses this
         syntax.  Examples of the usage of zero might include
         situations where a port number is unknown, or when the
         value zero is used as a wildcard in a filter.</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="InetAddress">InetAddress</td><td>OCTETSTR</td><td><pre>Denotes a generic Internet address.
An InetAddress value is always interpreted within the context
         of an InetAddressType value.  Every usage of the InetAddress
         textual convention is required to specify the InetAddressType
         object that provides the context.  It is suggested that the
         InetAddressType object be logically registered before the
         object(s) that use the InetAddress textual convention, if
         they appear in the same logical row.
The value of an InetAddress object must always be
         consistent with the value of the associated InetAddressType
         object.  Attempts to set an InetAddress object to a value
         inconsistent with the associated InetAddressType
         must fail with an inconsistentValue error.
When this textual convention is used as the syntax of an
         index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128
         sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2, STD 58.  In this case,
         the object definition MUST include a 'SIZE' clause to
         limit the number of potential instance sub-identifiers;
         otherwise the applicable constraints MUST be stated in
         the appropriate conceptual row DESCRIPTION clauses, or
         in the surrounding documentation if there is no single

unknown(0)  An unknown address type.  This value MUST
                     be used if the value of the corresponding

                     It may also be used to indicate an IP address
                     that is not in one of the formats defined
                     below.
ipv4(1)     An IPv4 address as defined by the
                     InetAddressIPv4 textual convention.
ipv6(2)     An IPv6 address as defined by the
                     InetAddressIPv6 textual convention.
ipv4z(3)    A non-global IPv4 address including a zone
                     index as defined by the InetAddressIPv4z
                     textual convention.
ipv6z(4)    A non-global IPv6 address including a zone
                     index as defined by the InetAddressIPv6z
                     textual convention.
dns(16)     A DNS domain name as defined by the
                     InetAddressDNS textual convention.
Each definition of a concrete InetAddressType value must be
         accompanied by a definition of a textual convention for use
         with that InetAddressType.
To support future extensions, the InetAddressType textual
         convention SHOULD NOT be sub-typed in object type definitions.
         It MAY be sub-typed in compliance statements in order to
         require only a subset of these address types for a compliant
         implementation.
Implementations must ensure that InetAddressType objects
         and any dependent objects (e.g., InetAddress objects) are
         consistent.  An inconsistentValue error must be generated
         if an attempt to change an InetAddressType object would,
         for example, lead to an undefined InetAddress value.  In
particular, InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs must be
         changed together if the address type changes (e.g., from
         ipv6(2) to ipv4(1)).</pre></td></tr>
