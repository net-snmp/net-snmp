<pre>
The minimum mteTriggerFrequency this system will
accept.  A system may use the larger values of this minimum to
lessen the impact of constant sampling.  For larger
sampling intervals the system samples less often and
suffers less overhead.  This object provides a way to enforce
such lower overhead for all triggers created after it is
set.

Unless explicitly resource limited, a system's value for
this object SHOULD be 1, allowing as small as a 1 second
interval for ongoing trigger sampling.

Changing this value will not invalidate an existing setting
of mteTriggerFrequency.

The maximum number of instance entries this system will
support for sampling.

These are the entries that maintain state, one for each
instance of each sampled object as selected by
mteTriggerValueID.  Note that wildcarded objects result
in multiple instances of this state.

A value of 0 indicates no preset limit, that is, the limit
is dynamic based on system operation and resources.

Unless explicitly resource limited, a system's value for
this object SHOULD be 0.

Changing this value will not eliminate or inhibit existing
sample state but could prevent allocation of additional state
information.

<pre>
The type of trigger test to perform.  For 'boolean' and
'threshold'  tests, the object at mteTriggerValueID MUST
evaluate to an integer, that is, anything that ends up encoded
for transmission (that is, in BER, not ASN.1) as an integer.

For 'existence', the specific test is as selected by
mteTriggerExistenceTest.  When an object appears, vanishes
or changes value, the trigger fires. If the object's
appearance caused the trigger firing, the object MUST
vanish before the trigger can be fired again for it, and
vice versa. If the trigger fired due to a change in the
object's value, it will be fired again on every successive
value change for that object.

For 'boolean', the specific test is as selected by
mteTriggerBooleanTest.  If the test result is true the trigger
fires.  The trigger will not fire again until the value has
become false and come back to true.

For 'threshold' the test works as described below for

mteTriggerThresholdStartup, mteTriggerThresholdRising, and
mteTriggerThresholdFalling.

Note that combining 'boolean' and 'threshold' tests on the
same object may be somewhat redundant.

<pre>
The type of sampling to perform.
An 'absoluteValue' sample requires only a single sample to be
        meaningful, and is exactly the value of the object at
        mteTriggerValueID at the sample time.
A 'deltaValue' requires two samples to be meaningful and is
        thus not available for testing until the second and subsequent
        samples after the object at mteTriggerValueID is first found
        to exist.  It is the difference between the two samples.  For
        unsigned values it is always positive, based on unsigned
        arithmetic.  For signed values it can be positive or negative.
For SNMP counters to be meaningful they should be sampled as a
        'deltaValue'.
For 'deltaValue' mteTriggerDeltaTable contains further
        parameters.
If only 'existence' is set in mteTriggerTest this object has
        no meaning.

  OBJECTID

  </td><td>Create</td>
<td>
<pre>
The object identifier of the MIB object to sample to see
if the trigger should fire.

This may be wildcarded by truncating all or part of the
instance portion, in which case the value is obtained
as if with a GetNext function, checking multiple values

if they exist.  If such wildcarding is applied,
mteTriggerValueIDWildcard must be 'true' and if not it must
be 'false'.

Bad object identifiers or a mismatch between truncating the
identifier and the value of mteTriggerValueIDWildcard result
in operation as one would expect when providing the wrong
identifier to a Get or GetNext operation.  The Get will fail
or get the wrong object.  The GetNext will indeed get whatever
is next, proceeding until it runs past the initial part of the
identifier and perhaps many unintended objects for confusing
results.  If the value syntax of those objects is not usable,
that results in a 'badType' error that terminates the scan.

Each instance that fills the wildcard is independent of any
additional instances, that is, wildcarded objects operate
as if there were a separate table entry for each instance
that fills the wildcard without having to actually predict
all possible instances ahead of time.

The management context from which to obtain mteTriggerValueID.
This may be wildcarded by leaving characters off the end.  For
        example use 'Repeater' to wildcard to 'Repeater1',
        'Repeater2', 'Repeater-999.87b', and so on.  To indicate such
        wildcarding is intended, mteTriggerContextNameWildcard must
        be 'true'.
Each instance that fills the wildcard is independent of any
        additional instances, that is, wildcarded objects operate
        as if there were a separate table entry for each instance
        that fills the wildcard without having to actually predict
        all possible instances ahead of time.
Operation of this feature assumes that the local system has a
        list of available contexts against which to apply the
        wildcard.  If the objects are being read from the local
        system, this is clearly the system's own list of contexts.
        For a remote system a local version of such a list is not
        defined by any current standard and may not be available, so
        this function MAY not be supported.

<pre>
The number of seconds to wait between trigger samples.  To
encourage consistency in sampling, the interval is measured
from the beginning of one check to the beginning of the next
and the timer is restarted immediately when it expires, not
when the check completes.

If the next sample begins before the previous one completed the
system may either attempt to make the check or treat this as an
error condition with the error 'sampleOverrun'.

A frequency of 0 indicates instantaneous recognition of the
condition.  This is not possible in many cases, but may
be supported in cases where it makes sense and the system is
able to do so.  This feature allows the MIB to be used in
implementations where such interrupt-driven behavior is
possible and is not likely to be supported for all MIB objects
even then since such sampling generally has to be tightly
integrated into low-level code.

Systems that can support this SHOULD document those cases
where it can be used.  In cases where it can not, setting this
object to 0 should be disallowed.

The type of existence test to perform.  The trigger fires
when the object at mteTriggerValueID is seen to go from
present to absent, from absent to present, or to have it's
value changed, depending on which tests are selected:

present(0) - when this test is selected, the trigger fires
when the mteTriggerValueID object goes from absent to present.

absent(1)  - when this test is selected, the trigger fires
when the mteTriggerValueID object goes from present to absent.
changed(2) - when this test is selected, the trigger fires
the mteTriggerValueID object value changes.

Once the trigger has fired for either presence or absence it
will not fire again for that state until the object has been

<h2>TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS</h2>
<ul>
<p>
These TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS are used in other parts of the document
above.  They are SNMP's way of defining a datatype that is used
repeatedly by other MIB objects.  Any implementation implementing
objects that use one of these definitions must follow its DESCRIPTION
clause as well as the DESCRIPTION clause of the object itself.
</p>
<table><tr class="label"><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><a name="SnmpTagValue">SnmpTagValue</td><td>OCTETSTR</td><td><pre>An octet string containing a tag value.
Tag values are preferably in human-readable form.

To facilitate internationalization, this information
is represented using the ISO/IEC IS 10646-1 character
set, encoded as an octet string using the UTF-8
character encoding scheme described in RFC 2279.

Since additional code points are added by amendments
to the 10646 standard from time to time,
implementations must be prepared to encounter any code
point from 0x00000000 to 0x7fffffff.

The use of control codes should be avoided, and certain

control codes are not allowed as described below.

For code points not directly supported by user
interface hardware or software, an alternative means
of entry and display, such as hexadecimal, may be
provided.

For information encoded in 7-bit US-ASCII, the UTF-8
representation is identical to the US-ASCII encoding.

Note that when this TC is used for an object that
is used or envisioned to be used as an index, then a
SIZE restriction must be specified so that the number
of sub-identifiers for any object instance does not
exceed the limit of 128, as defined by [RFC1905].

An object of this type contains a single tag value
which is used to select a set of entries in a table.

A tag value is an arbitrary string of octets, but
may not contain a delimiter character.  Delimiter
characters are defined to be one of the following:

    -  An ASCII space character (0x20).

    -  An ASCII TAB character (0x09).

    -  An ASCII carriage return (CR) character (0x0D).

    -  An ASCII line feed (LF) character (0x0A).

Delimiter characters are used to separate tag values
in a tag list.  An object of this type may only
contain a single tag value, and so delimiter
characters are not allowed in a value of this type.

Note that a tag value of 0 length means that no tag is
defined.  In other words, a tag value of 0 length would
never match anything in a tag list, and would never
select any table entries.

Some examples of valid tag values are:

    - 'acme'

    - 'router'

    - 'host'

The use of a tag value to select table entries is
application and MIB specific.</pre></td></tr>

creation and deletion of conceptual rows, and is used as the
value of the SYNTAX clause for the status column of a
conceptual row (as described in Section 7.7.1 of [2].)

The status column has six defined values:

     - `active', which indicates that the conceptual row is
     available for use by the managed device;

     - `notInService', which indicates that the conceptual
     row exists in the agent, but is unavailable for use by
     the managed device (see NOTE below); 'notInService' has
     no implication regarding the internal consistency of
     the row, availability of resources, or consistency with
     the current state of the managed device;

     - `notReady', which indicates that the conceptual row
     exists in the agent, but is missing information
     necessary in order to be available for use by the
     managed device (i.e., one or more required columns in
     the conceptual row have not been instanciated);

     - `createAndGo', which is supplied by a management
     station wishing to create a new instance of a
     conceptual row and to have its status automatically set
     to active, making it available for use by the managed
     device;

     - `createAndWait', which is supplied by a management
     station wishing to create a new instance of a
     conceptual row (but not make it available for use by
     the managed device); and,
     - `destroy', which is supplied by a management station
     wishing to delete all of the instances associated with
     an existing conceptual row.

Whereas five of the six values (all except `notReady') may
be specified in a management protocol set operation, only
three values will be returned in response to a management
protocol retrieval operation:  `notReady', `notInService' or
`active'.  That is, when queried, an existing conceptual row
has only three states:  it is either available for use by
the managed device (the status column has value `active');
it is not available for use by the managed device, though
the agent has sufficient information to attempt to make it
so (the status column has value `notInService'); or, it is
not available for use by the managed device, and an attempt
to make it so would fail because the agent has insufficient
information (the state column has value `notReady').

                         NOTE WELL

     This textual convention may be used for a MIB table,
     irrespective of whether the values of that table's
     conceptual rows are able to be modified while it is
     active, or whether its conceptual rows must be taken
     out of service in order to be modified.  That is, it is
     the responsibility of the DESCRIPTION clause of the
     status column to specify whether the status column must
     not be `active' in order for the value of some other
     column of the same conceptual row to be modified.  If
     such a specification is made, affected columns may be
     changed by an SNMP set PDU if the RowStatus would not
     be equal to `active' either immediately before or after
     processing the PDU.  In other words, if the PDU also
     contained a varbind that would change the RowStatus
     value, the column in question may be changed if the
     RowStatus was not equal to `active' as the PDU was
     received, or if the varbind sets the status</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="SnmpAdminString">SnmpAdminString</td><td>OCTETSTR</td><td><pre>An octet string containing administrative
information, preferably in human-readable form.

To facilitate internationalization, this
information is represented using the ISO/IEC
IS 10646-1 character set, encoded as an octet
string using the UTF-8 transformation format
described in [RFC2279].

Since additional code points are added by
amendments to the 10646 standard from time
to time, implementations must be prepared to
encounter any code point from 0x00000000 to
0x7fffffff.  Byte sequences that do not
correspond to the valid UTF-8 encoding of a
code point or are outside this range are
prohibited.

The use of control codes should be avoided.

When it is necessary to represent a newline,
the control code sequence CR LF should be used.

The use of leading or trailing white space should
be avoided.

For code points not directly supported by user
interface hardware or software, an alternative
means of entry and display, such as hexadecimal,
may be provided.

For information encoded in 7-bit US-ASCII,
the UTF-8 encoding is identical to the
US-ASCII encoding.

UTF-8 may require multiple bytes to represent a
single character / code point; thus the length
of this object in octets may be different from
the number of characters encoded.  Similarly,
size constraints refer to the number of encoded
octets, not the number of characters represented
by an encoding.

Note that when this TC is used for an object that
is used or envisioned to be used as an index, then
a SIZE restriction MUST be specified so that the
number of sub-identifiers for any object instance
does not exceed the limit of 128, as defined by
[RFC3416].

Note that the size of an SnmpAdminString object is
measured in octets, not characters.
