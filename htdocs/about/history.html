History
</p>

<p>The roots of the Net-SNMP project go all the way back to 1992, and
Carnegie-Mellon University.  The Network Group group at CMU (led by
Steve Waldbusser) developed an implementation of a relatively new
network management protocol - SNMP.  This suite included a library,
a selection of simple management commands, and an "agent" (which
reported most of the standard management information, as defined
in RFC 1213).  The code was made publicly available, and used
by a number of people (including several commercial companies).</p>

<p>One of these people that picked up on the CMU-SNMP suite was an
overworked system administrator at the University of California,
Davis - Wes Hardaker.  He extended the agent to provide more
information about his local systems (a private precursor to the
Host Resources MIB) and to flag certain error situations. He
also added a simple way for the agent to run additional scripts
and report the results, turning it into an extensible agent.
In 1995, this code was also made publicly available (as ucd-snmp
v3.0), and the UCD project was born.</p>

<p>One of the people that picked up on the UCD-SNMP suite was another
overworked system administrator at the University of Liverpool -
Dave Shield.  He was looking for a way to monitor the local print
system (which was itself also overloaded), and detect incipient
backlogs before they got out of control.  He submitted various
patches to Wes to improve the behaviour on HP-UX systems, with an
eye to replacing the vendor-supplied agent, but soon got distracted
into working on the UCD-SNMP code in its own right.</p>

<p>At about the same time, the UCD suite was picked up by yet another
overworked system administrator from Denmark - Niels Baggesen.  He
also submitted a number of patches to Wes, improving the behaviour
under Solaris, and generally working on the solidity and stability
of the code.  Eventually Wes got fed up of applying a stream of
patches, and opened the CVS code base up to both Dave and Niels,
together with Joe Marzot (who had been developing a Perl interface
to the SNMP library) and Mike Slifcak (who had been working on a
thread-safe API, among other things).
UCD-SNMP had become a fully-fledged collaborative Open Source project.</p>

<p>Over the years, the UCD code was used by an ever-increasing number
of people - many of whom submitted patches or suggested improvements
(both large and small).  Niels moved jobs, but continued to work on
the code.  Dave stayed put at Liverpool, and continued to work on the
code.  Wes even moved to Europe, and then back to the US, but continued
to work on the code.</p>

<p>In 1998, the IETF engaged Wes to develop a reference implentation
of the long-awaited SNMPv3 specifications - which were finally in the
process of being agreed (after a long, and not entirely trouble-free
gestation).  This work was initially done in parallel to the ongoing
maintenance of the public UCD v3 code, but eventually was merged back
into the main development tree.
This SNMPv3-capable suite (which also saw the first support for AgentX,
and dropped the now obsolete SNMPv2p) was released as ucd-snmp v4.0 in
August 1999.</p>

<p>Although the initial work had been started at UC Davis, and the
project still bore the name, the links with this institution were
growing increasingly tenuous.  Wes no longer worked there, and most
of the other core developers had never even seen the place!</p>

<p>Eventually in late 2000, the project changed its name to Net-SNMP
and relocated to SourceForge - allowing the administrative support
tasks to be more widely shared (rather than Wes having to do it all!)
At the same time, the code saw a major restructuring of the agent
framework, with a much more flexible MIB module API, and a number of
"helpers".  This was probably the most visible example of an ongoing
general modularisation of much of the code including a network
transport layer, pluggable SNMPv3 access control and security models,
and trap handling.</p>

<p>The result of all this activity was released in April 2002 as
net-snmp v5.0, and was the subject of an article in the Simple
Times later that year, describing some of the recent changes.</p>

<p>Even prior to the v5 release, and increasingly since, the Net-SNMP
suite has been picked up by more and more people, on an ever-widening
variety of systems.  The support for Microsoft Windows has improved
dramatically, due to the efforts of a large number of coders - not
least Mike Slifcak, Robert Story (who joined the core developers
shortly before the v5 release), and the two latest recruits - Alex
Burger and Andy Smith.</p>

<p>At the same time, the code has been ported to a number of different
embedded systems including &#181CLinux based systems, as well as being adopted 
as part of the default distribution of most Linux and BSD-based systems.
Also, a number of separately developed packages have appeared which
build upon the Net-SNMP framework - either higher-level management
applications, or to provide an API wrapper for other programming
languages.  Such independent packages are the most reliable indication
of the success of the Net-SNMP project (which has consistently been
in the top 2% of project activity on SourceForge for almost the whole
time it has been based there).</p>

<p>And what of the future?</p>
<p>The rate of development of the project shows no sign of slackening -
quite the reverse.  The level of traffic on the mailing lists has
climbed ever higher, and the number of people actively offering code
to the project has never been higher.</p>

<p>The latest release (v5.2.1 at the time of this writing) has seen the introduction of a "network
information abstraction layer", to improve the clarity and portability
of the original MIB-2 modules (which has included some of the oldest
code in the project - and it's shown!)</p>

<p>A similar idea is being investigated for the system hardware
information, pulling together the Host Resources and private 'ucdavis'
modules (and updating them in the light of practical experience).
And there is a long list of other ideas for developing the code.</p>

<p>In the slightly longer term, it's likely that the underlying SNMP
library will receive similar treatment to that seen with the v5 agent.
The most probable distinguishing feature of an eventual v6 release
will be a re-structured (and properly modularised) SNMP library,
allowing much greater flexibility in how it can be configured and used.</p>

<p>But predicting the future is notoriously unreliable, and it is quite
possible that the Net-SNMP project will develop in ways none of us
have yet thought of.  But it seems extremely unlikely that it will
disappear any time soon.</p>

<p>Watch this space....</p>
