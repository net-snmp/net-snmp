    <h1>The First UCD-SNMP Roundtable</h1>
    <p> (click on the pictures for a larger version)
    <p>We started the gathering by trying to find everyone at the
    conference.  Even with a meeting place picked beforehand, it still 
    wasn't easy.
    <p>We went to a restaurant that served, well, a lot of beer.  Their 
    menu was in a very small print and still took about 3 pages to
    list all the beers they had in stock.  Or in Mike Baer's case, not 
    in stock.
    <p> The entire group got together for a group photo (even with the
    waitress):<br>

    <p> Following dinner, we went to play pool at a local pool hall.
    There we learned that Michael Slifcak was the better of us.  
    <p> A good time was had by all, although very little formal
    discussions of coding happened, which was a good thing!
