    <h1>Net-SNMP Tutorial -- snmpget</h1>
    <p>
      The <b>snmpget</b> command can be used to retrieve data from a
      remote host given its host name, authentication information and
      an OID.  As a simple example:
<pre>
<ul>
% <b>snmpget -v 1 -c demopublic test.net-snmp.org system.sysUpTime.0</b>
system.sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks: (586731977) 67 days, 21:48:39.77
</ul>
</pre>
    <p>
      In the above example, <i>test.net-snmp.org</i> is the host name
      we wanted to talk to, using the SNMP community string
      <i>demopublic</i> and we requested the value of the OID
      <i>system.sysUpTime.0</i>.

    <p>
      Earlier versions of the ucd-snmp utilities used SNMPv1 by default
      and expected the community name to follow the host name. The net-snmp
      versions of these tools now typically use SNMPv3 by default, and require
      both the version <B>and</B> the community string to be given as
      command line options (as illustrated in these examples). SNMPv2c,
      which is similar in nature to SNMPv1 with small modifications, still
      used clear-text community names as "passwords" to authenticate the
      issuer of the command.  The result from a command using the
      SNMPv2c version would have been the same:
<pre>
<ul>
% <b>snmpget -v 2c -c demopublic test.net-snmp.org system.sysUpTime.0</b>
system.sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks: (586752671) 67 days, 21:52:06.71
</ul>
</pre>
    <p>
      All of the utilities allow abbreviation of the OIDs and do
      random searches by default, and hence you can only specify a
      small portion of the oid if you would prefer:
<pre>
<ul>
% <b>snmpget -v 2c -c demopublic test.net-snmp.org sysUpTime.0</b>
system.sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks: (586752671) 67 days, 21:52:06.71
</ul>
</pre>
    <p>
      A common mistake when using the snmpget command is to leave off
      the index into the data you're looking for.  In the above
      commands, the variable requested by the OID is a scalar and the
      index to scalars is always a simple '0' (zero), hence the
      trailing '.0' in all the oids above.  If you had left it off,
      you would have gotten an error.  Note that the errrors differ
      slightly between SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c:
<pre>
<ul>
% <b>snmpget -v 1 -c demopublic test.net-snmp.org sysUpTime</b>
Error in packet
Reason: (noSuchName) There is no such variable name in this MIB.
This name doesn't exist: system.sysUpTime
% <b>snmpget -v 2c -c demopublic test.net-snmp.org sysUpTime</b>
system.sysUpTime = No Such Instance currently exists
</ul>
</pre>
    <p>
      Multiple variables can be retrieved in one transaction as well:
<pre>
<ul>
% <b>snmpget -v 2c -c demopublic test.net-snmp.org sysUpTime.0 ucdDemoUserList.0</b>
system.sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks: (586903243) 67 days, 22:17:12.43
enterprises.ucdavis.ucdDemoMIB.ucdDemoMIBObjects.ucdDemoPublic.ucdDemoUserList.0 = " noAuthUser MD5User MD5DESUser SHAUser SHADESUser"
</ul>
</pre>
