<h2>TRAPs vs INFORMs</h2>
<p>
A quick recap on the difference between TRAPs and INFORMs: A TRAP is a
SNMP message sent from one application to another (which is typically
on a remote host).  They're purpose is merely to notify the other
application that something has happened, has been noticed, etc.  The
big problem with TRAPs is that they're unacknowledged so you don't
actually know if the remote application received your oh-so-important
message to it.  SNMPv2 PDUs fixed this by introducing the notion of an
INFORM, which is nothing more than an acknowledged TRAP.  IE, when the
remote application receives the INFORM it sends back a "I got it"
message.  This is nice because then the person sending the traps can
keep trying until the trap gets through.  The net-snmp <a
href="/docs/man/snmptrap.html"><b>snmptrap</b></a> program can send both
TRAPs and INFORMs.  Add -Ci to the command line of snmptrap if you
want it to send an INFORM instead, or call the <b>snmpinform</b>
command (which is functionally the same as snmptrap -Ci).  Note that
you must use snmpv2c or snmpv3 to send INFORMs.  <a
href="/docs/man/snmptrapd.html">snmptrapd</a> is able to receive and
display both INFORMs and TRAPs.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> snmptrapd will <b>not</b> display SNMPv3
TRAPs or INFORMs sent by a user which has not been configured using
the createUser directives discussed below.  They will be silently
dropped by the snmptrapd program.  If your run snmptrapd with the
-Dusm flag you'll get debugging output which says "no such user",
which is exactly why they're being dropped.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Starting with net-snmp 5.3, snmptrapd will no longer accept 
all traps by default. It must be configured with authorized SNMPv1/v2c 
community strings and/or SNMPv3 users. Non-authorized traps/informs will 
be dropped. Please refer to the 
<a href="/docs/man/snmptrapd.conf.html">snmptrapd.conf(5) manual page</a>
for details.

<p>
<h2>SNMPv3, users and engineIDs</h2>
<p>
TRAPs and INFORMs get a little
more complex with respect to SNMPv3.  The reason behind it is how the
user database is maintained.  SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c community based
messages merely always display the message to the end user.  SNMPv3
mandates that the message is rejected unless the SNMPv3 user sending
the trap already exists in the user database.  Sounds simple enough,
right?  Except for one small problem: The user database in a SNMPv3
application is actually referenced by a combination of the user's name
(called a "security Name") and a identifier for the given SNMP
application your talking to (called an "engineID").  Normally when you
use the rest of the snmp applications (<a
href="/man/snmpget.1.html">snmpget</a>, <a
href="/man/snmpwalk.1.html">snmpwalk</a>, ...) the application
"discovers" the remote engineID for you and then inserts the
username, engineID and passwords into user database based on this
remote engineID.  Makes things all nice and simple when talking to a
remote agent.
<h2>SNMPv3 INFORMs</h2>
<p>
INFORMs operate on a similar principal.  When you send an INFORM you
use the remote engineID when sending the message and the securityName
and engineID must exist as a pair in the remote user table.  The
snmptrap program discovers the remote engineID just like the rest of
the applications would do and then appropriately creates the SNMPv3
message with the proper user that the remote side is expecting to
get.  And all is well.  So, all you have to do when setting up the
remote snmptrapd application (assuming you're using our trap/inform
receiver) is to create a v3 user in the snmptrapd configuration
database.  You do this as follows:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Stop any currently running snmptrapd
<li> edit /var/net-snmp/snmptrapd.conf to insert the following line:
<pre>
  createUser myuser MD5 mypassword DES myotherpassword
</pre>
Where myuser is the security name you want to use, and mypassword is
your authentication password and myotherpassword is your encryption
password (or leave it blank if you want it to be the same or don't
want to use encryption).
<li> (re)start the snmptrapd program.
</ol>
<p>
Now, you should be able to use the snmpinform command to send the trap
demon a coldStart INFORM message:
<ul>
snmpinform -v 3 -u myuser -a MD5 -A mypassword -l authNoPriv localhost 42 coldStart.0
</ul>
<p>
If you did everything correctly, you should have seen something like
this in your snmptrapd output:
<p>
<pre>
    2001-10-31 11:21:05 localhost.localdomain [127.0.0.1]:
            sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (42) 0:00:00.42  snmpTrapOID.0 = OID: coldStart.0
</pre>
<h2>SNMPv3 TRAPs</h2>
SNMPv3 TRAPs are a bit more complicated in some ways, but it makes
sense the protocol works this way if you spend a long time thinking
about it.  The difference is that SNMPv3 TRAPs use the engineID of the
<b>local</b> application sending the trap rather than the engineID of
the <b>remote</b> application.  This means that you have to create
users in your remote user database with a bit more care and need to
create one for every engineID you wish to send traps from.  This means
that if you want to have 100 snmp agents send snmpv3 traps to your
trap receiver, you need 100 createUser directives in your
/var/net-snmp/snmptrapd.conf file.
<p>
So, try the following:
<ol>
<li> Stop any currently running snmptrapd
<li> edit /var/net-snmp/snmptrapd.conf to insert the following line:
<pre>
  createUser -e 0x0102030405 myuser MD5 mypassword DES myotherpassword
</pre>
Note that this time we explicitly set the engineID of the user to
0x0102030405 (which technically is not a recommended value, but it
really doesn't matter).
<li> (re)start the snmptrapd program.
</ol>
<p>
Now, you should be able to use the snmptrap command to send the trap
demon a coldStart v3 TRAP message:
<ul>
snmptrap -e 0x0102030405 -v 3 -u myuser -a MD5 -A mypassword -l authNoPriv localhost 42 coldStart.0
</ul>
<p>
This should produce similar output as the example above did.
<p>
I should go rambling on here about the intricate details of v3
engineIDs, INFORMs, TRAPs, engineID discovery, secret keys, passwords,
localized keys, etc.  But it took the SNMPv3 working group 18223 lines
of text (RFCs 2570 - 2575) to try and explain it all, so I don't think
I'll reiterate that here.
