    <p>
      One of the questions that comes up on our mailing lists a lot
      is: <i>I just ran <a href="/man/mib2c.html">mib2c</a> on my
      MIB. What do I do now?</i>.  This tutorial, and the MIB for
      Dummies code approach, is designed to make your life as easy as
      possible.  In this tutorial we'll walk you through the entire
      process of creating C code starting from only a MIB definition.
      This should answer this question for you, assuming you're
      willing to use the MIB for Dummies approach to coding.
    </p><p>
      One of the output code styles that mib2c supports is a style
      called <i>"MIB for Dummies"</i>.  This configuration file is
      called <i>"mib2c.mfd.conf"</i> and is what you would pass to the
      -c argument of mib2c to get it to produce the style of code this
      tutorial is going to discuss.  It will generate mib-module code
      which is designed to plug into an agent when developing Net-SNMP
      agent extensions.
    </p><p>
      One of the primary motivations for writing the MIBs for Dummies
      configuration file was to reduce the amount of SNMP knowledge
      needed to implement a MIB. When using the MFD configuration file
      (mib2c.mfd.conf), mib2c will generate <i>template</i> code that
      hides much of the SNMP (or Net-SNMP) specific details for
      implementing a module, and allows the rest of the template code
      to use simple C data structures that you are probably more
      familiar with. Most of the template functions are short and
      simple, with a clearly defined purpose.
    </p><p>
      Another motivation was to separate the method used to locate the
      data for an incoming request to the SNMP agent from the methods
      that manipulate the data. The data lookup for MFD modules uses
      the <var>netsnmp_container</var> interface. Data ordering can be
      tricky in SNMP, since the lexicographical ordering required by
      SNMP specification isn't always intuitive, and the index
      specified in the MIB you have to implement might not match the
      order in which your data is currently stored. But the MFD
      configuration file can help you out with this problem too.
    </p>
    <p>
      The templates generated by the MFD configuration file fall into
      several categories: data structures, data lookup and data
      manipulation. Data structures contain the data used to answer
      a request. Data lookup is finding
      the right data for a request. Data manipulation is either
      returning existing values or setting new values.
    </p>
    <hr width=80%>
    <a name="struct"><h2>2.0 Data Structures</h2></a>
    <p>
      There are 4 important data structures used in an MFD module.
      They are the <var>user context</var>, the <var>mib context</var>, 
      the <var>data context</var> and the the <var>row request context</var>.
    <h3>2.1 User Context</h3>
    <p>
      The user context is a pointer provided by user during module
      initialization. It is not used by the MFD code, other than to
      save it for the user. If your module needs access to some
      external data, you can use this pointer instead of a global
      variable.
    </p>
    <h3>2.2 MIB context</h3>
    <p>
      The MIB context is a generated structure which is used to
      store the MIB indexes for a row.
    </p>
    <h3>2.3 Data Context</h3>
    <p>
      The data context structure should contain all the data needed to get
      or set a value. The MFD configuration file will generate a data
      context structure with sufficient storage for all the objects
      defined in the MIB being implemented. (Later in the tutorial, we'll talk
      about using existing structures.)
    </p>
    <h3>2.4 Row Request Context</h3>
    <p>
      The row request context ties together all the other contexts.
      The table container will have a row request context for each
      row in the table.
    </p>
    <hr width=60%>
    <a name="lookup"><h2>3.0 Data Lookup</h2></a>
    <p>
      There are lots of different ways to access data. Your data store may be
      a linked list, a text file, a database or an API to some device.
      Instead of trying to deal with all of the possiblities in the template
      code, the <var>netsnmp_container</var> interface is used.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are currently two different interfaces between the MFD
      template code and the <var>netsnmp_container</var> used to locate
      data for a request.
    <p>
    <h3>3.1 container-cached</h3>
    <p>
      The default method, which is generic enough to handle just about any
      situation, is the <var>container-cached</var> method. The combines
      two feature of net-snmp: the <var>cache helper</var> and the
      <var>netsnmp_container</var>. Quite simply,
      the first time a request is received for a table, a
      <var>cache_load</var> routine is called with a pointer to a
      <var>netsnmp_container</var>. That function accesses any
      datastore(s) that contain data, and adds all the rows to
      the container. The container is then used to find the rows
      for the incoming request, and (optionally) kept around
      a configurable number of seconds for future requests. While
      the basic principle is simple, the flexiblity makes this
      method the preferred method for most situations. More details
      on this <var>cache helper</var> can be found on the
      <var><a href="../../agent/group__cache__handler.html">cache
          handler</a></var> page.
    </p>
    <h3>3.2 Iterator (unsorted-external)</h3>
    <p>
      The <var>unsorted-external</var> method is a wrapper around
      the <var>netsnmp_continer</var> <var>container_iterator</var>.
      This method is also very flexible, with a very simple interface.
      When a request is received for a table, a <var>get_next</var> routine
      is called repeatedly to loop over every item in the datastore(s).
      The agent will then select the appropriate row for the request.
      Due to the inefficency of this method, it is only recommended
      for small datastores, or when memory contraints are very tight
      and response times are not important.
    </p>
    <h3>3.3 Direct</h3>
    <p>
      For advanced users, a custom <var>netsnmp_container</var> can
      be used. This method lets you wrap a <var>netsnmp_container</var>
      around an existing datastore/access method. Be warned, however,
      that the implementation for the container's <var>find-next</var>
      method must handle SNMP's lexicographical ordering rules.
    </p>
    <hr width=60%>
    <a name="manip"><h2>4.0 Data manipulation</h2></a>
    <p>
      Once the appropriate data structure is retrieved from the data store,
      the data manipulation routines will be called. For each object defined
      in your mib module, a function will be generated to extract the data
      value from the data structure located during the data lookup phase.
    </p><p>
      For read-write objects, things get more complicated. SET requests
      are processed in multiple steps, so there are multiple functions
      generated for each object. These include functions for syntax checks,
      value checks, undo setup, value set and undo value set.
      Additionlly, several functions are generated per table, for tasks which
      only need to be performed once, even if multiple objects are set for a
      given index. Two examples are consistency checks and commit changes.
      All of these functions will be discussed in more detail later in the
      tutorial.
    </p>
    <hr width=60%>
    <a name="start"><h2>5.0 Getting Started</h2></a>
    <p>
      There are several example implementations. The process of
      implementing a module using the MFD configuration file can be
      broken down into several steps.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Generating the template code by running mib2c appropriately
      <li>Implementing a <var>netsnmp_container</var> for data access
      <li>Implementing <b>GET</b> request functions
      <li>Implementing <b>SET</b> request functions
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>5.1 Basic Tables</h3>
    <p>
      These examples are fairly basic, and should suffice for most simple
      MIB tables and data stores.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="if-mib/index.html">IF-MIB Tables</a> (A description
      of the IF-MIB can be found <a href="http://www.net-snmp.org/mibs/ifMIB.html">here</a>)
        <ul>
          <li><a href="if-mib/ifTable/index.html">ifTable</a>: A simple
            table with a single integer index which gets it's data from
            a text file. (Partial, read-only implementation)
          <li><!--a href="if-mib/ifXTable/index.html"-->ifXTable<!--/a-->: A simple
            table with a single integer index which gets it's data from
            a text file, and caches it. (Partial, read-only implementation)
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>5.2 Intermediate Tables</h3>
    <p>
      These examples are sill fairly basic, but we are starting to add
      a few twists.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>TBD (set support; row creation?)
    </ul>
    <h3>5.3 Advanced Tables</h3>
    <p>
      These examples show how to deal with complicated issues that
      sometimes come up while implementing MIB modules..
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>TBD ...
    </ul>
