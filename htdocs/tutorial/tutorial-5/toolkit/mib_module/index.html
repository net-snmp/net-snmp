    <h1>Net-SNMP Tutorial -- MIB Module</h1>
    <h2>Writing a net-snmp MIB Module</h2>
    <p>
      Here we discuss how to write a simple mib module, to extend the
      agent using C code.
    <p>
      The 5.0 net-snmp agent is designed to give the mib module writer
      an easier task when it comes to writing mib code.  To do this,
      it provides some "helper" modules that you can make use of to
      suit your specific needs.  The net-snmp agent handles things in
      "chains" of these helpers, and you can add helpers to your
      calling chain to do things for you.
    <h3> MIBs For Dummies and mib2c </h3>
    <p>
      Here is tutorial on <a href="../mfd/index.html">using mib2c
	and mib2c.mfd.conf</a> to generate a code template for a table.
    <h3> A simple scalar attached to a variable </h3>
    <p>
      Here is <a
		 href="http://www.net-snmp.org/dev/agent/scalar__int_8c-example.html">some
	example</a> code that describes how to implement a simple,
      single scalar which is based on a variable.
    <h3> A simple scalar with the value returned from code </h3>
    <p>
      Here is <a
		 href="http://www.net-snmp.org/dev/agent/delayed__instance_8c-example.html">some
	example</a> code that describes how to implement a generic
      instance (not tied to a variable, like the above example) as
      well has how to delay answering queries for a bit (in the
      example, an alarm is set to add a delay to the answer).
    <h3> A table of data, stored within the agent </h3>
    <p>
      Here is a more complex <a
				href="http://www.net-snmp.org/dev/agent/data__set_8c-example.html"> example</a>
      example that implements a table, where the table data is
      completely contained within the agent.
    <h3> Sending SNMP notifications (traps and informs) from inside the agent. </h3>
    <p>
      Here is an <a href="http://www.net-snmp.org/dev/agent/notification_8c-example.html">example</a> of how to use the agent's internal notification
      sending API to send a notification to all of the agent's trap receivers.
    <h3> The older (and thus backward compatible) ucd-snmp 4.X API </h3>
    <p>
      Of course, you can continue to write code using the older API
      set.  A tutorial on it can be found <a
      href="http://www.net-snmp.org/tutorial/tutorial-4/toolkit/mib_module/">here</a>.

      <h2> The MIB Module API </h2>
    <p>
      The new API is documented more completely <a
      href="http://www.net-snmp.org/dev/agent/group__handler.html#_details">here</a>.
      Additionally, see the complete list of (mostly) documented
      available helpers and other information <a
      href="http://www.net-snmp.org/dev/agent/modules.html">here</a>

    <h2>Compiling in your new MIB module</h2>
    <p>
      There are a few ways to get your new MIB module loaded and
      accessible via SNMP requests.  We'll discuss all three ways
      separately.  To make this easy to test the procedures outlined
      below, we've provided three simple mib modules which implement
      the three simple scalars in the <a
      href="NET-SNMP-TUTORIAL-MIB.txt">NET-SNMP-TUTORIAL-MIB</a> MIB.
      To see how MIBs can be properly used by the tools, please see
      the <a
      href="http://www.net-snmp.org/tutorial-5/commands/mib-options.html">mib-options
      tutorial</a>.
      <ol>
      <li>
	Compile it into the master agent.
	<p>
	  Lets assume you're going to compile in a new mib module.
	  For our example, lets use the <a
	  href="nstAgentModuleObject.c">example mib module</a> and
	  it's <a href="nstAgentModuleObject.h">header file</a>.  To
	  do this, you would put the nstAgentModuleObject.h and
	  nstAgentModuleObject.c files into the net-snmp source code
	  directory.  You do this by copying them into a
	  agent/mibgroup/nstAgentModuleObject.h and
	  agent/mibgroup/nstAgentModuleObject.c file.
	<p>
	  Next, you have to configure the package to find them and
	  compile them into the agent.  To do this, you run the
	  configure script giving it the extra module names you want
	  it to load:

	  <pre>
% <b>./configure --with-mib-modules="nstAgentModuleObject"</b>
	</pre>

	<p>
	  If you had multiple modules to include (like a second "XXX"
	  module, for example), you can separate them with spaces
	  inside the quotes (e.g.,
	  --with-mib-modules="nstAgentModuleObject XXX").
	<p>
	  Note that nstAgentModuleObject is the prefix and the
	  configure script will actually look for a
	  nstAgentModuleObject.h and a nstAgentModuleObject.c file.
	  You <b>must</b> have a .h file and you can not get it to work
	  with just a .c file.
	<p>
	  Build your new agent with your new code in it by running make:
	<pre>
% <b>make</b>
	</pre>
	<p>
	  Finally, install the whole lot by running make install:
    <pre>
% <b>make install</b>
    </pre>
	<p>
	  You can test out the functionality by starting the snmpd
	  agent:
    <pre>
% <b>/usr/local/sbin/snmpd</b>
    </pre>
	<p>
	  And then running snmpget and snmpset on the scalar object
	  [proper authentication information not shown in this command]:
    <pre>
% <b>snmpget localhost NET-SNMP-TUTORIAL-MIB::nstAgentModuleObject.0</b>
NET-SNMP-TUTORIAL-MIB::nstAgentModuleObject.0 = INTEGER: 1

% <b>snmpset localhost NET-SNMP-TUTORIAL-MIB::nstAgentModuleObject.0 = 5</b>
NET-SNMP-TUTORIAL-MIB::nstAgentModuleObject.0 = INTEGER: 5

% <b>snmpget localhost NET-SNMP-TUTORIAL-MIB::nstAgentModuleObject.0</b>
NET-SNMP-TUTORIAL-MIB::nstAgentModuleObject.0 = INTEGER: 5
    </pre>

      <li> You can also compile your code into a "subagent" which then
      attaches itself to the master agent using the <a
      href="http://www.scguild.com/agentx/">AgentX
      subagent protocol</a>.  Our libraries provide support to make
      this easy to do and this is discussed in greater detail in a <a
      href="../demon/index.html">later section</a>.

	<br>
	<br>
      <li> Finally, you can also compile your code into pluggable
      shared object and tell the snmpd agent to load it.  This is also
      discussed in greater detail in a <a
      href="../dlmod/index.html">later section</a>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <h2>Set Processing</h2>
    <p>
      To process an SNMP-SET, the agent must use a series of calls to
      the mib module code to ensure that processing of all sets in the
      incoming packet can be successful.  This gives you or other mib
      modules the chance to bail out early on in the transaction
      sequence and thus stop all of the transactions in the set from
      happening.  This is important for continuity.  However, it makes 
      set code processing a bit more complex.  Let's examine a simple
      state diagram that the master agent uses at each step of the
      way:
    <p>
      <center><img src=set-actions.jpg></center>
    <p>
      In a perfect operation with no failures, we take the vertical
      path on the left.  If <b>any</b> of the mib modules being acted
      upon returns an error of any kind, we will branch to the right
      to one of the failure states where you must clean up and
      possibly undo what you did in previous steps.
