<H1>Extending the UCD-SNMP agent</H1>

This series of documents describe the procedure
for writing code to extend the functionality of the
v4 UCD-SNMP network management agent.
Modules written using this procedure will also work with the v5
Net-SNMP agent, though this will not take advantage of the new
handler-based helper mechanisms.  See the on-line documentation
for more information and examples of that mechanism.
We would be very interested in comment and feedback about
how useful you find this description,
and ways in which it could be improved.
<P>
The information is designed to be read in order - the structure being:
<OL>
<LI><A HREF="01-intro.html">Overview & Introduction</A>
<LI><A HREF="02-mib.html">MIB files, and how they relate to the agent implementation</A>
<LI><A HREF="03-header.html">Header files</A>
<LI><A HREF="04-basic-code.html">The basic structure of module implementation code</A>
<LI><A HREF="05-nontable.html">The details of non-table based implementations</A>
<LI><A HREF="06-table1.html">The details of simple table based implementations</A>
<LI><A HREF="07-table2.html">The details of more general table based implementations</A>
<LI><A HREF="08-writing.html">How to implement SET-able variables</A>
</OL>
<p>
While the document is intended to be generally self-contained,
it does occasionally refer to code files shipped with the main UCD
distribution (in particular the example module), and it may prove
useful to have these files available for reference.
</p>
<P>
The 5.0 release line includes a new agent architecture, with
a new <A HREF=/dev/agent/group__handler.html>handler-based API</A>.
While the traditional UCD-SNMP API described here can also be used,
the new approach provides a number of additional facilities.
<HR>
There's also a 
<A HREF=CheckList.html>step-by-step checklist</A>
that you can use if adding your MIB module doesn't
seem to be working.
