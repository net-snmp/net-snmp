<H1>Checklist for adding a MIB module to the UCD-SNMP agent</H1>

We're often asked how to add a MIB implementation module
(e.g. as produced by <TT>mib2c</TT>) to the agent, and check
that it's working.
The following is a step-by-step guide to the process,
with frequent checks to confirm that things have been
successful.
<P>
Please note that if, at any point, a particular check fails
to return the results expected you should <B><I>not</I></B>
proceed with the next stage.  Instead you should try and
identify what went wrong since the previous (successful)
check, and fix it.
<P>
Note further that the various names (MIB files, modules, objects
and numeric OIDs) are examples only.  You should replace them with
the appropriate names for the MIB module you are implementing.
Such names will be given in <I>italics</I> in the examples.

<OL>
<LI> Remove any old copies of the source tree that you might have,
     and unpack a new, clean copy from the tarball.
     <BR>
     <I>(This isn't strictly necessary, but is a useful step to
         avoid earlier attempts getting in the way)</I>
     <P>

<LI> Copy the two files produced by <TT>mib2c</TT> into the
     directory <TT>agent/mibgroup</TT> in this clean tree:
     <PRE>
          $ cd ~/ucd-snmp-4.2.1
               <I>or wherever the tarball was unpacked to</I>
          $ cd agent/mibgroup
          $ cp ~/<I>mymib</I>.[ch] <B>.</B>
               <I>or wherever the files were generated</I>
     </PRE>

<LI> Configure the source code to include your new MIB module:
     <PRE>
          $ cd ../..
          $ ./configure --with-mib-modules=<I>mymib</I>
     </PRE>

			<UL>
			<LI><B><I>Check 1</I></B><BR>
			       Does the file <TT>agent/Makefile</TT>
			       contain a reference to <I>mymib</I>?
			</UL>
			<P>

<LI> Compile the suite (<TT>make</TT>) but don't install it yet.

			<P>
			<UL>
			<LI><B><I>Check 2</I></B><BR>
			       Is there now a file
			       <TT>agent/mibgroup/<I>mymib</I>.o</TT>?
			</UL>
			<P>

<LI> Run the newly-compiled agent in a 'testing' mode:
     <PRE>
          $ agent/snmpd -f -L -d -p 9999
     </PRE>
     <I>(This runs the agent on a temporary port (<TT> -p 9999</TT>)
         so that it doesn't need special priviledges, or interfere
         with your 'normal' agent.
         Incoming and outgoing packets are printed (<TT>-d</TT>),
         to show what's happening, and the agent is run as a 'non-daemon'
         command (<TT>-f -L</TT>) so that you can see these messages.
         Note that this ties up the current shell, so you'll need to
         run the following checks in a different terminal window.)</I>.

			<P>
			<UL>
			<LI><B><I>Check 3a</I></B><BR>
			       Does the agent respond to requests?
     <PRE>
          $ snmpgetnext -p 9999 localhost public system
	  system.sysDescr.0 = <I>something or other</I>
     </PRE>

			</UL>
			<P>
			<UL>
			<LI><B><I>Check 3b</I></B><BR>
			       Does the agent respond to requests
			       for objects in your new module?
     <PRE>
          $ snmpgetnext -p 9999 localhost public <I>.1.3.6.1.4.1.9999</I>
	  <I>.1.3.6.1.4.1.9999.1.1.0 = something or other</I>
     </PRE>
     <I>(Replace this OID with the OID at the top of the subtree that
         you're implementing in this module.)</I>
			</UL>
			<P>
			<UL>
			<LI><B><I>Check 3c</I></B><BR>
			       Can the tools parse the MIB file?
     <PRE>
          $ snmpgetnext -OS -p 9999 localhost public <I>MY-MIB::myObject</I>
	  <I>MY-MIB::myObject.0 = something or other</I>
     </PRE>
     <I>(Replace the module name with the name of the MIB module you are
         implementing, and the object name with the name of one of the
         objects in this module.)</I>
			</UL>
			<P>

<LI> Kill the 'test' agent.  (Ctrl-C should do it).

<LI> Install the agent.  (<TT>make install</TT>).

			<P>
			<UL>
			<LI><B><I>Check 4</I></B><BR>
                               Does the newly installed agent have the
                               correct (i.e. recent) timestamp?
     <PRE>
          $ ls -l <I>/usr/local/sbin/snmpd</I>
     </PRE>
     <I>(This is the most likely location for the new agent.  But use
     whatever was reported as part of the <TT>make install</TT> output).</I>
			</UL>
			<P>

<LI> Run the newly-installed agent in a 'testing' mode, as before.
     <PRE>
          $ /usr/local/sbin/snmpd -f -L -d -p 9999
     </PRE>
			<P>
			<UL>
			<LI><B><I>Check 5</I></B><BR>
                               Repeat Checks 3a, 3b and 3c
			</UL>
</OL>

If all this succeeds, your newly installed agent appears to be working
correctly.  
It's probably safe to consider running this new agent instead of the one
that comes with your distribution (if this is what you want to do).
