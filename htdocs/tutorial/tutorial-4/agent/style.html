<H1>Net-SNMP Developers' C Language Style Guide</H1>

<STRONG>Compiled by Wes Hardaker and Dave Shield</STRONG>,
based on discussion on the net-snmp-coders mailing list during

2001.
<BR>
The layout of this document is modelled on the
<A HREF="http://dev.apache.org/styleguide.html">
Apache Developers' C Language Style Guide.</A>

<HR>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
It has long been recognised that code is much easier to understand
and maintain if it is layed out in a clear and consistant manner.
This guide is an attempt to set out an agreed set of style conventions
for use within the Net-SNMP project, balancing the sometimes conflicting
desires for relatively compact, yet readable code.
If you wish to assist in the development of this software by
providing code or patches, please could you ensure that any such code
abides by the guidelines outlined here.
<P>
It is inevitable that this will not exactly match your preferred
coding style.  Many of the individual guidelines could quite easily
choose one of the other common alternatives, without significantly
affecting the overall readability.  But the benefits of having an
agreed style are really only achieved if it is applied consistently
to the whole of the code.  The core developers have had to restrain
their individual preferences to achieve this - please can you do likewise.

<P>This style can be generated (more or less) with the following arguments
to GNU indent:

<P><UL><CODE>-orig -nbc -bap -di16 -nfca -nfc1 -nut</CODE></UL>

(but see caveats below).
Not all versions of indent will necessarily recognise all these options.
<BR>
Note that these guidelines are just that - <I><B>guidelines</B></I> - and there
may occasionally be good reasons for departing from them, in order to
improve the readability of a particular section of code.  However
"<I>I don't like this style</I>" does not count as a good reason!

<H2>The Guidelines</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Procedures and Functions
  <UL>
   <LI>The name of a procedure should be as descriptive as possible
       (within the constraints of a reasonable-length name!)
       Multiple words within a procedure name should be
       <CODE>separated_by_underscores</CODE>,
       not <CODE>denotedByCapitalisation</CODE>.
   <LI>Each procedure should be preceded by a block comment,
       starting "<CODE>/**&nbsp;</CODE>" (note the trailing space),
       describing its purpose, return values and
       any memory-management implications.
   <LI>The return type, and the procedure declaration should follow,
       on <I><B>separate</B></I> lines,
       both starting in the first column.
   <LI>A procedure returning a pointer to a type should declare this as
      <CODE>netsnmp_<I>type</I> *</CODE> with a single space between the
      type name and the pointer character.
      <BR>
       Note that <CODE>indent -di16</CODE> will mis-format such declarations.
   <LI>Related procedures (such as might typically be defined within a
       single code file) should be given names starting with a common token.
       (See also debugging output below).
       <BR>
       <FONT COLOR=red><I>
       'Private' procedures, used only within this file, should be given
       a name starting with an underscore, followed by the common token.
       </I></FONT>
   <LI>Procedures should be declared with ANSI-style arguments.
   <LI>This should be no space between the procedure name and the opening
       bracket, or between the brackets and the arguments.
   <LI>Pointers belong with the parameter name, not the type.
       <BR>
       (Note that <CODE>indent</CODE> will mis-format this for non-recognised
        types).
   <LI>The opening and closing braces should be in the first column.
   <LI>Each procedure should be followed by two blank lines.
  </UL>

<LI> Comments
  <UL>
   <LI>All comments on the same line as code should start in column 33
       (except where long code lines dictates otherwise).
       These can be either single-line, or 'block' format.
   <LI>All other comments should be in 'block' format, with the starting
       and ending tokens on separate lines from the main text.
       The body lines should each start with a '*' character.
   <LI>Such block comments should precede the relevant code,
       and be indented by four spaces.
   <LI>All comments must use the C-style <CODE> /* */ </CODE> syntax,
       rather than the C++-style <CODE> //</CODE>
  </UL>

<LI> Variables and statements
  <UL>
   <LI>Variable declarations should be lined up, with the name
       starting in column 16 <BR>(i.e. <CODE>indent -di16</CODE> - but
       see procedures returning pointer types above).
   <LI>Net-SNMP data structures all start with the prefix <CODE>netsnmp_</CODE>.
       The basic template for such structures is: <PRE>
            typedef struct netsnmp_<I>wombat</I>_s {
                <I>int something_or_other</I>
            } netsnmp_<I>wombat</I>; </PRE>
       Note that the underlying <CODE>struct netsnmp_<I>wombat</I>_s</CODE>
       type will rarely be used directly.
   <LI>Variable names should be used consistently between related procedures.
   <LI>Debugging output should use the same prefix token as the
       procedure name.
   <LI>Comparisons with a constant value should be of the form
       <CODE>if (NULL == variable)</CODE>.
       <BR><FONT COLOR=red><I>
       Should this hold for <B><I>all</I></B> binary comparisons, or just equality.
       </I></FONT>
  </UL>

<LI> Code layout and indentation
  <UL>
   <LI>Each level of indentation of code is four spaces,
       and tab characters should not be used.
   <LI>Lines should normally be no longer than 75 characters in width.
   <LI>Longer statements should be broken over two or more lines,
       with the continuation lines indented by a further four characters.
       Continuations of long procedure calls (or similar parenthesised lists)
       should be indented to match the opening bracket.
   <LI>If possible, long statement lines should be broken immediately after
       a binary operator.
   <LI>Opening braces should be on the same line as the relevant control
       statement, with the corresponding closing brace on a line of its own.
       (i.e. <I>K&amp;R</I>-style).
   <LI>The closing brace of an <CODE>if</CODE> block, the <CODE>else</CODE>
       keyword and the following brace should all be on the same line.
       (i.e. <I>cuddle-else</I> style - <CODE>} else {</CODE>).
   <LI>Single-statement control structures should use explicit braces.
   <LI>There should be no space between a procedure call and the opening
       bracket, nor between the opening and closing
       brackets and the corresponding arguments.
   <LI>There should be a single space between a control statement
       keyword (<CODE>if</CODE>, <CODE>switch</CODE>, <CODE>while</CODE>,
       <CODE>for</CODE>, etc) and the opening bracket of the test.
   <LI>There should be a single space after each semicolon in a <CODE>for
       </CODE> control statement, and after each comma in argument lists
       (including procedure declarations).
   <LI>There should be (at least) a single space on either side of a
       binary operator.
   <LI><CODE>case</CODE> keywords should be indented to match the
       initial <CODE>switch</CODE> statement.
   <LI>There should be no space between a cast and the item being modified,
       and a single space between the type and pointer character (if present)
       - i.e. <CODE>(char *)buf</CODE>.
       <FONT COLOR=red><I>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;OK?
       </I></FONT>
  </UL>
</UL>

<H2>Details and Examples</H2>

<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Indentation, General Style</STRONG>

<P>Each level of indentation of code is four spaces. Tab characters
   should never be used. Specific indentation rules for function
   declarations and control-flow keywords are given below.

<P>Example:
<PRE>
    main(int argc, char **argc)
    {
        if (argc != 0) {
            fprintf(stderr, "No arguments allowed\n");
            exit(1);
        }
        exit(0);
    }
</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME="long-exps">If an expression</A> (or a routine declaration or
invocation) would extend 
past column 80, the terms or arguments are wrapped at a convenient spot
and the wrapped portion is indented under the first term in the expression
(or the first argument to the function).
>Conditional expressions should be wrapped to keep single or
parenthesized terms as atomic as possible, and place Boolean operators
at either the start (preferable) or end of the line.
</P>
<P>
Example:
</P>
<PRE>
     static const char *really_long_name(int i, int j,
                                         const char *args, void *foo,
                                         int k)

     if (cond1 &amp;&amp; (item2 || item3) &amp;&amp; (!item4)
         &amp;&amp; (item5 || item6) &amp;&amp; item7) {
         do_a_thing();
     }
</PRE>
<LI><STRONG>Comments</STRONG>

<P>Provide comments which explain the function of code where it is not
   clear from the code itself.  Provide rationale where necessary for
   particular bits of code.

<P>Comments should be indented to same level as the surrounding text.

<P>Example:

<PRE>
    code;
    /* comment */
    code;
</PRE>

<LI><STRONG>Function Declaration and Layout</STRONG>

<P>Functions are laid out as follows:

<PRE>
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        code;
    }
</PRE>

<P>The return type is placed on the same line as the function. Arguments
   (if any) are given in ANSI style. If no arguments, declare function
   as <SAMP>void</SAMP>. No space
   between function name and opening bracket, single space after comma
   separating each argument. The opening brace is placed on the line
   after the definition, indented to line up with the start of the 
   return type text. The code is indented with four spaces, and the closing
   brace is indented to line up with the opening brace.  <STRONG>Also
   see the section on indenting <A HREF="#long-exps">long declarations
   and invocations</A>.</STRONG>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Function Calls</STRONG>

<P>Space after commas in function calls. No space between function name
   and opening bracket.
<PRE>
    f(a, b);
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Also
   see the section on indenting <A HREF="#long-exps">long declarations
   and invocations</A>.</STRONG>
</P>
<LI><STRONG>Flow-Control Layout</STRONG>

<P>Flow-control statements (<SAMP>if</SAMP>, <SAMP>while</SAMP>,
   <SAMP>for</SAMP>, <EM>etc.</EM>) are laid out as in this example:

<PRE>
    if (expr) {
        code;
    }
    else {
        code;
    }
</PRE>

<P>There is a space between the keyword and the opening bracket.
   Opening brace placed on same line as the flow keyword. The code
   itself is indented by four spaces. The closing brace is indented to
   line up with the opening brace. If an <SAMP>else</SAMP> clause is used, the
   <SAMP>else</SAMP> keyword is placed on the line following the closing
   brace and is indented to line up with the corresponding
   <SAMP>if</SAMP>.  <STRONG>Also 
   see the section on indenting <A HREF="#long-exps">long
   expressions</A>.</STRONG>
   
<P>
 
<LI><STRONG><SAMP>for</SAMP> Layout</STRONG>

<P>Space after the semi-colons. Example:

<PRE>
    for (a; b; c)
</PRE>

<LI><STRONG><SAMP>switch</SAMP> Layout</STRONG>

<P><SAMP>case</SAMP> lines within a <SAMP>switch()</SAMP> are indented to
   same level as the switch 
   statement itself. The code for each case is indented by four spaces.
   Braces are laid out as for other control-flow keywords. Example:

<PRE>
    switch (x) {
    case a:
        code;
    case b:
        code;
    }
</PRE>

<LI><STRONG>Expressions</STRONG>

<P>Space before and after assignment and other and operators. No space
   between unary operators (increment, decrement, and negation) and the
   lvalue. Examples:

<PRE>
    a = b
    a + b
    a &lt; b
    a = -b
    a = !b
    ++a
</PRE>

<LI><STRONG>Capitalisation of Enums</STRONG>

<P>No rule.
