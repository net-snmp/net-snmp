The Net-SNMP logo
</p>

<div align="center">
  <p><img height=228 src="/images/logos/net-snmp-5.2.jpg"> </a></p>
</div>

  
<p>The above logo was created with the gracious help of UCD-SNMP and Net-SNMP users who sent in images to help create this logo.  This is a true demonstration of the internet oriented aspect of this project.</p>

<h3>How was it created?</h3>
<ol>
<li>A single image was repeatedly used to lay out the diagram using xfig.</li>
<li>The xfig save file (which is ascii) was converted to reference all the images rather than just the single repeated one, and then used to turn the layout into a jpeg.</li>
<li>The drop shadow was added using <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">gimp</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>A side affect to this process is that xfig outputs its save file in fairly random order, so everytime I create a new logo the images are randomly placed. The only ones that are consistent are
the 2 composing the dash in the center, which are a image from UCDavis and a picture of the <a href="/party/">first ucd-snmp roundtable</a>.</p>
