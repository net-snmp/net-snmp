.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
A group of handlers to implement individual leaf objects and instances (both scalar objects, and individual objects and instances within a table). 
.PP
These handlers will typically allow control to be passed down to a lower level, user-provided handler, but this is (usually) optional.
