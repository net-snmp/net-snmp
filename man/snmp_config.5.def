.SH NAME
snmp_config - describes how to configure the ucd-snmp applications.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The ucd-snmp package uses various configuration files to configure its 
applications.  This manual page merely describes the overall nature of 
them, so that the other manual pages don't have to.
.SH "DIRECTORIES SEARCHED"
First off, there are numerous places that configuration files can be
found and read from.  By default, the applications look for
configuration files in the following 3 directories, in order:
DATADIR/snmp, LIBDIR/snmp, and $HOME/.snmp.  In each of these
directories, it looks for files with the extension of both .conf and
\.local.conf (reading the second on last).  In this manner, there are 6 
default places a configuration file can exist for any given
configuration file type.
.PP
Additionally, the above default search path can be overridden by
setting the environment variable SNMPCONFPATH to a ':' separated
list of directories to search for.
.PP
Finally, applications that store persistent data will also look in the 
/var/snmp directory for configuration files there.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE TYPES"
Each application may use multiple configuration files, which will
configure various different aspects of the application.  For instance, 
the SNMP agent (snmpd) knows how to understand configuration
directives in both the snmpd.conf and the snmp.conf files.  In fact,
most applications understand how to read the contents of the snmp.conf 
files.  Note, however, that configuration directives understood in one 
file may not be understood in another file.  For further information,
read the associated manual page with each configuration file type.
Also, most of the applications support a '-H' switch on the command
line that will list the configuration files it will look for and the
directives in each one that it understands.
.PP
The snmp.conf configuration file is intended to be a application suite 
wide configuration file that supports directives that are useful for
controlling the fundamental nature of all of the snmp applications,
such as how they all manipulate and parse the textual SNMP mib files.
.SH COMMENTS
.PP
Any lines beginning with the character '#' in the configuration files
are treated as a comment and are not parsed.
.SH "API Interface"
.PP
Information about writing C code that makes use of this system in
either the agent's mib modules or in applications can be found in the
read_config(3) manual page.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
