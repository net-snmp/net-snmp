         An entry shall be placed in the storage table for
         each logical area of storage that is allocated and
         has fixed resource limits.  The amount of storage
         represented in an entity is the amount actually
         usable by the requesting entity, and excludes loss
         due to formatting or file system reference
         information.

         These entries are associated with logical storage
         areas, as might be seen by an application, rather
         than physical storage entities which are typically
         seen by an operating system.  Storage such as tapes
         and floppies without file systems on them are
         typically not allocated in chunks by the operating
         system to requesting applications, and therefore
         shouldn't appear in this table.  Examples of valid
         storage for this table include disk partitions,
         file systems, ram (for some architectures this is
         further segmented into regular memory, extended
         memory, and so on), backing store for virtual
         memory (`swap space').

         This table is intended to be a useful diagnostic
         for `out of memory' and `out of buffers' types of
         failures.  In addition, it can be a useful
         performance monitoring tool for tracking memory,
