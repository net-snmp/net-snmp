.SH NAME
DATADIR/snmp/snmptrapd.conf - configuration file for the ucd-snmp trap demon.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B snmptrapd.conf
is the configuration file(s) which define how the ucd-snmp SNMP trap
receiving demon operates when it receives a trap.  These files may
contain any of the directives found in the
.B DIRECTIVES
section below.  This file is not required for the demon to operate,
receive, or report traps.  It is used solely as a method of providing
extensibility to the trap demon.
.SH PLEASE READ FIRST
First, make sure you have read the snmp_config(5) manual page that
describes how the ucd-snmp configuration files operate, where they
are located and how they all work together.
.SH DIRECTIVES
.IP "traphandle OID|default PROGRAM [ARGS ...]"
The
.I traphandle
configuration directive configures the snmptrapd program to launch an
external program any time it receives a trap matching the OID token.
If the OID token is the word
.I default
then any trap not matching any other trap handler will call this
default one instead.
The program is fed details about the trap to its standard input, in the
following format, one entry per line:
.RS
.IP HOSTNAME
The name of the host in question that sent the trap, as determined by
gethostbyaddr().
.br
.IP IPADDRESS
The IP address of the host that sent the trap.
.br
.IP VARBINDS
A list of variable bindings that describe the trap and the variables
enclosed in it.  The first token on the line, up until the space, in
the OID and the remainder of the line is its value.  The first OID
should be the system.sysUpTime.0 OID, and the second should be
the ...snmpTrap.snmpTrapOID.0 OID.  The remainder of the OIDs, with the
possible exception of the last one, are the variable bindings
contained within the trap.  For SNMPv1 traps, the very last OID will
be the ...snmpTrap.snmpTrapEnterprise OID and its value.  Essentially, 
SNMPv1 traps have been converted to the SNMPv2 trap PDU type by the
method described in the SNMPv1/SNMPv2 coexistence document, for which
I forget the appropriate RFC number.
.RE
.IP "createUser username (MD5|SHA) authpassphrase [DES]"
See the snmpd.conf manual page for a description of how to create
SNMPv3 users.  It's roughly the same, but the file name changes to
snmptrapd.conf from snmpd.conf. 
.RE
.IP "format1 format"
The format used to print a SNMPv1 TRAP message. See
.IR snmptrapd (8)
for the layout characters available.
.RE
.IP "format2 format"
The format used to print a SNMPv2 TRAP2 or INFORM message (note that
the SNMPv3 protocol uses SNMPv2 style TRAPs and INFORMs).
.SH NOTES
.IP o
The demon blocks on the executing traphandle commands.  (This should
be fixed in the future with an appropriate signal catch and wait()
combination).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
