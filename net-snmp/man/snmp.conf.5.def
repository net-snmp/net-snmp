.SH NAME
DATADIR/snmp/snmp.conf - configuration file for the ucd-snmp applications.
.br
~/.snmp/snmp.conf - personal configuration file.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B snmp.conf
is the configuration file which define how the ucd-snmp SNMP
applications operate.  Tokens that can be put in them are described in
the
.B DIRECTIVES
section below.
.SH PLEASE READ FIRST
Make sure you make these files read-only by the user if you are
storing sensitive information in them like pass-phrases!
.PP
First, make sure you have read the snmp_config(5) manual page that
describes how the ucd-snmp configuration files operate, where they
are located and how they all work together.
.SH DIRECTIVES
.IP "mibdirs (mib-dirs|+mib-dirs)"
Look for textual mibs to parse in the list of ':' separated
directories.  If the directive value starts with a '+' it prepends
this list to the front of the default directory list compiled into the
application.  Note that this value can be overridden by the
.B MIBDIRS
environment variable.
.IP "mibs (mib-tokens|+mib-tokens)"
Specifies a ':' separated list of mib tokens that represent textual
mib files that should be found and parsed.  If the directive value
starts with a '+' it prepends this list to the front of the default
mib token list compiled into the application.  The special keyword of
"ALL" forces all mibs files found to be read. Note that the value
specified here can be overridden by the
.B MIBS
environment variable.
.IP "mibfile file"
Specifies a textual mib file to read and parse, in addition to the
list read from the mibs token.  Note that the value
specified here can be overridden by the
.B MIBFILES
environment variable.
.IP "defaultPort port"
The default port number that all snmp applications and demons should use.
.IP "defVersion (v1|v2c|v3)"
The default snmp version to use.
.IP "defCommunity string"
The default snmpv1 and snmpv2c community string to use.
.IP "defSecurityName string"
The default snmpv3 USM security name you want to use for snmpv3 requests.
.IP "defContext      string"
The default snmpv3 context name you want to use.
.IP "defPassphrase   string"
.IP "defAuthPassphrase string"
.IP "defPrivPassphrase string"
The default snmpv3 USM passphrase(s) to use.  
.B defPassphrase
will be used for both authentication and privacy pass phrases if it is 
specified.
.IP "defAuthType     MD5|SHA"
The snmpv3 USM authentication type to use.  Only MD5 is supported out
of the box at this time.
.IP "defPrivType     DES"
The snmpv3 USM privacy type to use.  Currently, only DES is the
possible value, and isn't supported out of the box due to U.S. export
restrictions.
.IP "defSecurityLevel noAuthNoPriv|authNoPriv|authPriv"
The snmpv3 default security level to use.
.IP "showMibErrors   (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Whether or not to display textual mib parsing errors when commands are
run.
.IP "strictCommentTerm (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Whether or not mibs that are parsed should be strict about comment
termination.  "--" terminates a comment if this is true.  Many
distributed mibs have broken comments in them, hence this option.
.IP "mibAllowUnderline (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Allow underline characters in mibs (illegal).
.IP "mibWarningLevel integerValue"
The minimum warning level of the warnings printed by the mib parser.
.IP "logTimestamp      (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Whether the commands should log timestamps with their error/message
logging or not.  Note that output will not look as pretty with
timestamps if the source code that is doing the logging does
incremental logging of messages that are not line buffered before
being passed to the logging routines.
.IP "printNumericEnums (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Equivalent to -Oe
.IP "printNumericOids (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Equivalent to -On
.IP "dontBreakdownOids (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Equivalent to -Ob
.IP "escapeQuotes (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Equivalent to -OE
.IP "quickPrinting (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Equivalent to -Oq
.IP "suffixPrinting (0|1|2)"
If the value is 1, its equivalent to -Os and if the value is 2 it's
equivalent to -OS.
.IP "extendedIndex (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Equivalent to -OX
.IP "noRangeCheck (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
disables the validation of values that is done by snmpset before issuing
the request to the agent.
.IP "dumpPacket      (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Whether the commands should dump packets by default.
.IP "doDebugging (1|0)"
Turns on debugging for all applications run if set to 1.
.IP "debugTokens token[,token...]"
The debugging tokens that should be printed.  See the
.I snmpcmd(1)
manual page for debugging usage details.
