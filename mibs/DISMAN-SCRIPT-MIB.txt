         The smScriptOperStatus object may have the following values:
         - `enabled' indicates that the script is available and can
            be started by a launch table entry.

         - `disabled' indicates that the script can not be used.

         - `editing' indicates that the script can be modified in the
           smCodeTable.

         - `retrieving' indicates that the script is currently being
           loaded from non-volatile storage or a remote system.

         - `compiling' indicates that the script is currently being
           compiled by the runtime system.

         - `noSuchScript' indicates that the script does not exist
           at the smScriptSource.

         - `accessDenied' indicates that the script can not be loaded
           from the smScriptSource due to a lack of permissions.

         - `wrongLanguage' indicates that the script can not be loaded
           from the smScriptSource because of a language mismatch.

         - `wrongVersion' indicates that the script can not be loaded
           from the smScriptSource because of a language version
           mismatch.

         - `compilationFailed' indicates that the compilation failed.

         - `noResourcesLeft' indicates that the runtime system does
           not have enough resources to load the script.

         - `unknownProtocol' indicates that the script could not be
           loaded from the smScriptSource because the requested
           protocol is not supported.

         - `protocolFailure' indicates that the script could not be
           loaded from the smScriptSource because of a protocol
           failure.

         - `genericError' indicates that the script could not be
           loaded due to an error condition not listed above.

         The `retrieving' and `compiling' states are transient states
         which will either lead to one of the error states or the
         `enabled' state. The `disabled' and `editing' states are
         administrative states which are only reached by explicit
         management operations.

         non-volatile or permanent storage.

         The script controlled by this row is written into local

         Deleting conceptual rows from this table includes the

smLaunchStart OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX      Integer32 (0..2147483647)
    MAX-ACCESS  read-create
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This object is used to start the execution of scripts.
         When retrieved, the value will be the value of smRunIndex
         for the last script that started execution by manipulating
         this object. The value will be zero if no script started
         execution yet.

         A script is started by setting this object to an unused
         smRunIndex value. A new row in the smRunTable will be
         created which is indexed by the value supplied by the
         set-request in addition to the value of smLaunchOwner and
         smLaunchName. An unused value can be obtained by reading
         the smLaunchRunIndexNext object.
         Setting this object to the special value 0 will start
         the script with a self-generated smRunIndex value. The
         consequence is that the script invoker has no reliable
         way to determine the smRunIndex value for this script
         invocation and that the invoker has therefore no way
         to obtain the results from this script invocation. The
         special value 0 is however useful for scheduled script
         invocations.

         If this object is set, the following checks must be
         performed:

         1) The value of the smLaunchOperStatus object in this
            entry of the smLaunchTable must be `enabled'.
         2) The values of smLaunchScriptOwner and
            smLaunchScriptName of this row must identify an
            existing entry in the smScriptTable.
         3) The value of smScriptOperStatus of this entry must
            be `enabled'.
         4) The principal performing the set operation must have
            read access to the script. This must be checked by
            calling the isAccessAllowed abstract service interface
            defined in RFC 2271 on the row in the smScriptTable
            identified by smLaunchScriptOwner and smLaunchScriptName.
            The isAccessAllowed abstract service interface must be
            called on all columnar objects in the smScriptTable with
            a MAX-ACCESS value different than `not-accessible'. The
            test fails as soon as a call indicates that access is
            not allowed.
         5) If the value provided by the set operation is not 0,
            a check must be made that the value is currently not
            in use. Otherwise, if the value provided by the set
            operation is 0, a suitable unused value must be
            generated.
         6) The number of currently executing scripts invoked
            from this smLaunchTable entry must be less than
            smLaunchMaxRunning.

         Attempts to start a script will fail with an
         inconsistentValue error if one of the checks described
         above fails.

         Otherwise, if all checks have been passed, a new entry
         in the smRunTable will be created indexed by smLaunchOwner,
         smLaunchName and the new value for smRunIndex. The value
         of smLaunchArgument will be copied into smRunArgument,
         the value of smLaunchLifeTime will be copied to
         smRunLifeTime, and the value of smLaunchExpireTime
         will be copied to smRunExpireTime.

         The smRunStartTime will be set to the current time and
         the smRunState will be set to `initializing' before the
         script execution is initiated in the appropriate runtime
         system.

         Note, the data type and the range of this object must
         be consistent with the smRunIndex object. Since this
         object might be written from the scheduling MIB, the
         data type Integer32 rather than Unsigned32 is used."
